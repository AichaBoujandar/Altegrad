   (left), Paul South (center) and Amanda Cavanagh (right) study how well
   their plants modified to bypass photorespiration perform beside
   unmodified plants in real-world conditions. They found that plants
   engineered with a synthetic shortcut are about 40 percent more
   productive. Credit: Claire Benjamin/RIPE Project
