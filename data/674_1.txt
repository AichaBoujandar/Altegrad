HOSPITALITY MEANS BUSINESS!

   Our name says â€œHotel and Restaurant,â€ but we are so much more! We are a
   specialized business degree program in hospitality, offering
   undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees in hotel and restaurant
   management, hospitality management, global hospitality business and
   hospitality administration, respectively, as well as a minor in
   beverage management and marketing. Our graduates realize incredible
   career opportunities around the globe in lodging, restaurants, catering
   and events, casino, spa and club management, food safety, conference
   services, hospitality technology, sports and entertainment venues,
   marketing and social media, tourism, revenue management, wine and
   spirits distribution â€“ and these are just a few specialized areas of
   hospitality. A huge part of our industry is food & beverage, so our
   students spend quality time in chef coats learning basic cooking, food
   safety and knife skills. Our focus is always on management, not whatâ€™s
   on the menu! Still, many aspiring chefs come here to learn about the
   business and operational side of the restaurant industry either before
   or after they complete a culinary program. Here, we prepare the
   hospitality leaders of tomorrow. And with our specialized team of
   counselors in our Career Development office, we are ready and willing
   to help you navigate this global industry through internships and
   career fairs where we bring top hospitality employers to you.

   Hospitality is the worldâ€™s No. 1 employer. We ARE hospitality. We will
   help you find your place in our industry!
