   Woburn Safari Park announced the arrival of two African Lion cubs,
   which were born to parents Zuri and Joco in late July. The cubs spend
   most of their time in the den with their mother but are expected to
   move into the Lion exhibit later this month.

   Keepers have already spotted the youngsters playing with each other and
   with their momâ€™s tail and they are looking stronger on their legs every
   day. Born weighing just over two pounds each, the cubs will begin to be
   weaned from their mother onto meat at around 10-12 weeks old and will
   be fully weaned by the time they are 6-8 months old.

   Lioness Zuri, 5, is extremely protective of her new young, and
   naturally can become aggressive if disturbed. Keepers prepared for the
   birth by creating a secluded den in one compartment of the Lion house
   for Zuri and her cubs, so they can enjoy bonding in a quiet, private
   area. In the wild, a Lioness will give birth and keep her cubs in a den
   of thick dense cover, like acacia bushes, so keepers have tried to
   replicate this environment as much as possible.

   Keepers are feeding Zuri five days out of every seven, monitoring how
   much she eats each day to decide when she is fed. Normally the Lions
   are fed large meals every four days to mimic wild hunting patterns,
   including feast days and fast periods.

   Craig Lancaster, Team Leader for Carnivores at Woburn Safari Park,
   said, â€œItâ€™s hugely exciting to have new Lion cubs at the Park and we
   are so pleased that they seem to be settling in so well. They arenâ€™t
   crying a lot and are already looking chunky and healthy, which
   indicates that they are feeding well and are content in their
   surroundings.

   â€œThe public will be able to view the cubs in the side pen after all
   their vaccinations are up to date in late September. We will ensure the
   vets are happy with their progress before they are moved into the main
   Lion enclosure later on in the year.â€

   Once ranging across most of Africa, the Middle East, and southwestern
   Asia, Lions have suffered drastic population declines in the past 50
   years. Most of the 20,000-50,000 Lions remaining in Africa reside in
   protected areas such as parks and reserves. Tourism, and the revenue it
   creates, is a strong incentive for Lion conservation. These majestic
   Cats are listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for
   Conservation of Nature.
