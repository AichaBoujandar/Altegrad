Everdrive GB

   Yet again Krikzz has arrived on the scene and created something
   incredible. The Everdrive GB, as it stands, is the definitive solution
   to enjoying Game Boy games on the go, thanks to the many features seen
   in his other flash cartridges. Allowing you to insert a MicroSD Card
   into the device, you’ll be able to store the entire library of Game Boy
   and Game Boy Color games on a single cartridge. Each and every game
   played will create its own save file too, allowing you to pick up where
   you left off on the next boot up.

   And if that wasn’t enough already, the Everdrive GB is fully compatible
   with the Super Game Boy, allowing the chosen ROM files to display their
   colourful Super Nintendo borders too. This is then further enhanced by
   the addition of Game Genie code functionality too.
