   When simplybeautifuleating popped up in my Instagram feed I was
   immediately taken by surprise and thought, this person is doing
   something REALLY cool and different from all the other foodie feeds I
   was following. Every week I look forward to seeing her incredibly
   gorgeous photos and reading her recipes while laughing out loud the
   entire time. No one else can make something as simple as baking muffins
   so funny and lighthearted.
