   Texas Instruments INA185 Current Sense Amplifier is designed for use in
   cost-sensitive space-constrained applications. This device is a
   bidirectional, current-sense amplifier (also called a current-shunt
   monitor). The INA185 senses voltage drop across a current-sense
   resistor at common-mode voltages from –0.2V to +26V, independent of the
   supply voltage. The INA185 integrates a matched resistor gain network
   in four, fixed-gain device options: 20V/V, 50V/V, 100V/V, or 200V/V.
   This matched gain resistor network minimizes gain error and reduces the
   temperature drift.

   The INA185 operates from a single 2.7V to 5.5V power supply. The device
   draws a maximum supply current of 260µA and features a high slew rate.
   The INA185 also has a high bandwidth making this device an excellent
   choice for many power-supply and motor-control applications.
