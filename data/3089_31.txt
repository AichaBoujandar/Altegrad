Dreamcast SD Card Adapter

   Before the GDEmu arrived on the scene, homebrew developers devised a
   way to load software onto the Sega Dreamcast using the serial port on
   the back. Although a breakthrough at the time, the serial port suffers
   from a very slow transfer rate and incompatibility issues. This is turn
   saw games needing to be modified, stripped of content, and patched to
   run from SD card via the device.

   While this may be a good cheap alternative to the GDEmu, you do get
   what you pay for. As of late the SD card adapter has been rather tricky
   to locate, with the few still out there often appearing for sale via
   eBay.
