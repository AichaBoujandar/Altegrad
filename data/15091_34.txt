Summer School on Geometric and Algebraic Combinatorics

   This two-week summer school will present an overview of a selection of
   topics in the crossroads between geometry, algebra, and combinatorics.
   It will consist of four one-week mini-courses given by leading experts,
   complemented with supervised exercise sessions, lectures by invited
   researchers, and research presentations by junior participants. The
   school is aimed at young researchers in geometric and algebraic
   combinatorics and related fields, although any interested researcher is
   welcome to participate. We expect the school to be an opportunity to
   bring together researchers from different backgrounds and foster new
   interactions. This school is part of the ongoing ANR project CAPPS.

   The school will take place at the Jussieu Campus of the Faculty of
   Science & Engineering of Sorbonne Université. Lectures will be at room
   15-25-104 at the 1st floor between towers 15 and 25.
