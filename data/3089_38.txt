Turbo Everdrive

   Surprise surprise, Krikzz is once again the forerunner when it comes to
   the TurboGrafx-16 and PC Engine consoles. The Turbo Everdrive is
   exactly what youâ€™d expect it to be, a microSD card enabled device that
   can load just about every hucard ever made into memory.

   The device works on both American and Japanese consoles with ease, and
   the entire library of PC Engine software can be squished onto a tiny
   128mb microSD card. And even better, the largest game ever made for the
   console works on the Turbo Everdrive too, Street Fighter II.
     * Storage: MicroSD Cards
     * Pros: Fantastic compatibility, quick loading, on-board reset button
     * Cons: Bare board cartridge due to the small size of hucards
