Mega Everdrive

   As mentioned previously, flash cartridge maestro Krikzz has a fond
   place in his heart for the Sega Mega Drive. This is in turn saw the
   hardware tinkerer return to the 16-bit console to create an even more
   powerful flash cartridge that’s yet to be bettered.

   The Mega Everdrive does everything the Everdrive MD can do, along with
   plenty more thanks to its overpowered (for the job) FPGA chip. Simply
   put, the prior 7MBit ROM size limit has been increased to 16MBit, games
   load within a second or two, save state functionality is introduced
   too, and the cartridge can be used as Mega CD Backup RAM cart too.

   It might be a bit more expensive, but the Mega Everdrive is all you’ll
   ever need when it comes to 16-bit Sega flash cartridges.
