   Surfshark is a relatively new VPN service, but it’s already making a
   name for itself.

   As a new provider, Surfshark offers a very rare bonus – unlimited
   simultaneous connections. If you want to protect your whole family (or
   use lots of devices yourself), you won’t find a better deal.

   Of course, this wouldn’t matter if Surfshark didn’t provide a good
   service – but it does. Its features include split tunneling, double
   encryption, kill switch protection, and a security suite called
   CleanWeb that blocks ads and prevents malware. You’ll also find extra
   obfuscation settings with the NoBorders mode, while Camouflage
   Mode prevents even your ISP from seeing that you’re connected to a VPN.

   Surfshark’s growing network includes over 800 servers in 50+ countries.
   This means you’ll always have fast and reliable access to your desired
   content.

   Don’t Use If:
     * You need to install your VPN on a router – Surfshark doesn’t have a
       dedicated router app.

   Overall, Surfshark is an impressive VPN with premium value and simple,
   stylish apps. They offer great bargains with high discounts on
   long-term plans and a one-month refund period.
