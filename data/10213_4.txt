   The Time a Law Clerk Successfully Forged a New Shakespeare Play to
   Impress His Dad

   William-Henry Ireland's father thought he was dull, uninspired, and
   talentless. So William-Henry began a project that would lead to
   national excitement, a riot, and with any luck, the love and adoration
   of his father. He forged an â€œundiscoveredâ€ new play by William
   Shakespeareâ€”and it actually premiered on a London stage.

   What Did Shakespeare Sound Like?

   We can't know for sure what Shakespeare sounded like. Although there
   are no recordings of Shakespeareâ€”Edison would not invent his phonograph
   for another 260 or so yearsâ€”scholars have a pretty good idea of how the
   bard might have sounded.
