   "The great shyness of my childhood made me an diligent observer. After
   2 Masters degrees in finance and the rejection from my dream of working
   in the most prestigious financial centre I decided to become an
   independent investor. A few years later trying to share my knowledge to
   the world I was struck by a serious illness which made me focus on one
   thing : bringing the most value to people in order to build their own
   dreams ."

My values:

Anticipation, Commitment and Pedagogy

   Capturing weak behavioural signals helps to predict what will happen
   and how long it will take. Commitment means delivering what is promised
   at all costs. Finally, pedagogy is the remedy I use to prevent any
   damaging decisions that may be made out of emotion.
