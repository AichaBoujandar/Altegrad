Red Panda Triplets Born at Virginia Zoo

September 14, 2019

   The Virginia Zoo announced the birth of triplet Red Panda cubs to Masu,
   a three-year-old female, and four-year-old dad Timur. The three cubs,
   two males and one female, were born off-exhibit at the Zooâ€™s Animal
   Wellness Campus on June 18, 2019. Red Panda cubs weigh approximately
   five ounces at birth, and by two months of age, the cubs each weighed
   just over one pound. The zoo announced the births in late August.

   â€œHaving Red Panda triplets is a unique situation,â€ said Dr. Colleen
   Clabbers, the Zooâ€™s Veterinarian. â€œItâ€™s a lot of work for mom to care
   for three newborns, but Masu is doing a great job caring for
   the triplets and all three have been thriving.â€

   Masu, who had her first litter of cubs last year, gave birth in an
   indoor, climate-controlled den where she has been nursing and bonding
   with her cubs in this quiet environment. The den is not viewable by zoo
   guests and is monitored by Zoo Keepers and Animal Care Staff. Red Panda
   cubs typically remain in the nest with mom for about three months, even
   in the wild.

   Masu and the cubs will move back to the Red Panda exhibit later this
   fall when Keepers feel the little ones can confidently navigate the
   trees and other exhibit features.

   â€œOur Animal Care team had a great strategy last year in moving Masu to
   the Animal Wellness Campus while she was still pregnant, providing
   privacy for her first birth experience. She took great care of her cubs
   last year, which is why we opted to do the same thing again this time
   around,â€ said Greg Bockheim, Executive Director of the Virginia Zoo.

   The zoo auctioned naming rights for the cubs, but they have not yet
   announced the names.

   Red Pandas are tree-dwelling animals found in forested mountain habitat
   in Myanmar, Nepal, India, Bhutan, Tibet and China. While they share the
   same name as Giant Pandas, the two species are not closely related. Red
   Pandas are the only living member of their taxonomic family. Slightly
   larger than a domestic Cat and with markings similar to a Raccoon, Red
   Pandas have soft, dense reddish-brown and white fur. They feed mainly
   on bamboo, but also eat plant shoots, leaves, fruit and insects. Red
   Pandas are shy and solitary except when mating or raising offspring.

   Red Pandas are listed as Endangered by the International Union for
   Conservation of Nature. Habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and
   inbreeding due to isolated populations contribute to the decline. There
   are fewer than 10,000 mature individuals estimated to remain in the
   wild.
