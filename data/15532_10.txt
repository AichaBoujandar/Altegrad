10. ZenMate

   A simple VPN that gets the job done
     * Dedicated torrenting profile: No (allows P2P traffic)
     * Works with: Netflix
     * Available on: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Chrome, Firefox, Opera
     * Data logging: Strict no-logging policy

   We finish our comparison with a provider that sticks to the basics.
   ZenMate doesn’t stand out as much as other services that made our list,
   but there’s a very good reason it’s here.

   For a modest price, ZenMate gives you OpenVPN encryption, a tight
   zero-logging policy, and over 290 servers in 30 countries. P2P traffic
   is allowed, even if there isn’t a separate profile for torrenting, and
   speeds are fast enough for HD streaming without issues.

   There’s also a kill switch, so you won’t leak sensitive data if your
   connection crashes. This used to happen frequently– but after some
   improvements, ZenMate is more stable than ever.

   If live chat support matters to you, ZenMate VPN will probably
   disappoint as it only offers a ticket system. Still, you can expect
   timely and detailed responses from the friendly staff.

   We like to see VPN providers getting better and better. ZenMate is one
   of those providers – with massive improvements to the overall service,
   this VPN has grown enough to deserve a spot among the best of 2019.

   Don’t Use If:
     * You need a VPN for streaming. Zenmate only really gives you access
       to Netflix.
