Colecovision Ultimate SD Cartridge

   Identical in form to the aforementioned Atarimax Atari 5200 Ultimate
   SD, the Colecovision’s equivalent is something fans of the system don’t
   want to miss. The Colecovision Ultimate SD Cartridge offers
   compatibility with all standard 32K or less ROM images, along with more
   advanced titles such as Mario Bros with functionality for Mega-Cart
   Bank-switched ROM images up to 512kb.

   And if that last sentence made sense to you, you’ll no doubt need to
   consider picking one of these up.
     * Storage: SD Cards
     * Pros: Fantastic compatibility
     * Cons: None
