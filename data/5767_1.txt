Original Links

   This is the way Links from the Underground read, as of January 27,
   1994. That was 4 days after the first web page visitor from outside my
   college January 23. This is when it was entitled Justin's Home Page,
   and encompassed my getting started info, my picture of me and Ollie, a
   picture of Cary Grant on Acid, and my recommended links all in one. The
   pages were served off my laptop from my dorm room. Simplicity. Personal
   web history!
