Floppy Disk based Devices - Super Wild Card, Super Pro Fighter etc

   During the 90s, the Far East produced a plethora of devices which can
   only be described as primitive versions of the flash cartridges we use
   today. Most of these were large plug-in devices that featured an entire
   floppy disk drive within its casing. Game cartridges could be written
   onto floppy disk, with large games being split onto multiple disks.

   Needless to say these devices are a pain to use today, however, hold
   plenty of nostalgia and allure due to their colourful (and criminal)
   past.
