   Chester Zooâ€™s two Red Panda cubs have been revealed as a boy and a
   girl, during their first ever health check-up.

   The precious twelve-week-old twins, classed by conservationists as
   endangered in the wild, were born on June 22 to mum, Nima, and dad,
   Koda, who have kept them tucked up in their nest boxes since birth.

   Now, specialist vets and keepers have had their very first look at the
   delightful duo, examining the pair during the health check, where they
   were weighed, sexed and vaccinated. Each of the fluffy youngsters was
   given a full, clean bill of health.

   James Andrewes, Assistant Team Manager at the zoo, said, â€œThese Red
   Panda twins are wonderful, important new additions to the carefully
   managed breeding programme for the species, which is working to
   increase the safety-net population in Europe as numbers in the wild
   continue to decline. Happily, both cubs are developing very well indeed
   and the health MOTs weâ€™ve been able to perform confirmed that mum Nima
   is clearly doing a great job of caring for them.â€

   James continued, â€œWe also discovered the genders of each of the cubs -
   one male and one female - and returned them to their mum as soon as
   weâ€™d finished giving them a quick once over. Nima took them straight
   back to her nest and itâ€™ll be a few weeks now until the cubs start to
   develop the confidence to come out and explore by themselves. Before
   theyâ€™re able to stand on their own feet, it is though possible that
   some lucky people will have the occasional glimpse of Nima carrying
   them from nest to nest by the scruffs of their necks.â€

   Red Pandas are found in the mountainous regions of Nepal, India,
   Bhutan, Myanmar and southern China where their wild number is estimated
   at fewer than 10,000 â€“ a 40% decline over the past 50 years.

   This decrease is a direct result of human actions, such as widespread
   habitat destruction, trapping for the illegal pet trade and poaching
   for their iconic red fur â€“ which in some countries is used to make hats
   for newly-weds as a symbol of happy marriage.

   Conservationists at Chester Zoo have called on the public help to fight
   the illegal wildlife trade that is driving species to extinction around
   the world. People can report any suspicious activity they may spot,
   online or on holiday, via the zooâ€™s online illegal wildlife trade
   reporting form: www.chesterzoo.org/illegalwildlifetrade

   In recent years, Chester Zoo has been fighting for the future of the
   Red Panda through habitat-focused conservation projects in the Sichuan
   Mountains of China, where they can be found among the bamboo forests.
