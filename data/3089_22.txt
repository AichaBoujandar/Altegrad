   Nintendo Pokemon Mini Flash Cartridges

PokeCard 512 Rev2

   Believe it or not but the incredibly tiny Pokemon Mini handheld has
   been gifted a flash card for its incredibly small library of 10 games.
   The device known as the PokeCard was created by an enthusiast of the
   system, which has since been expanded to allow multiple game ROMs at
   once and programming of the cartridge via USB.

   Sadly though these cartridges are somewhat near impossible to secure as
   they are all made by hand by one Pokemon Mini fan. After announcing the
   arrival of these devices a few years back he has been inundated with
   requests for the cartridge, so much so that contacting him today for a
   device will probably go a miss.
