Neo Myth 64

   Similar to the NEO SNES / SFC Myth above, Neoflashâ€™s Nintendo 64
   solution also relies on the same storage solution - Game Boy Advance
   flash cards. Given there are much simpler alternatives on offer for the
   same price or cheaper, avoid this outdated and overpriced solution.
     * Storage: Game Boy Advance Flash Cards
     * Pros: None
     * Cons: Outdated, overpriced, requires other Neoflash hardware to run
