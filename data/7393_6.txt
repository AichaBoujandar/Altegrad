   Julie Resnick, Co-Founder, feedfeed
   Debi has been an early and active member of the feedfeed community for
   the past few years. We have had the benefit of working with her both as
   editor on our website and as a content creator for many of our brand
   partners. Debi carefully creates health oriented recipes and shoots
   beautifully composed photos time and again. She is a pleasure to work
   with and puts 110% into everything she takes on. We truly value her
   involvement and participation in our community.

   Your photography is beautiful and your writing is very thoughtful and
   thorough about our brand. I appreciate all your enthusiasm and hard
   work with this post and being one of the first to debut the new Crown
   Bundt Pan!
