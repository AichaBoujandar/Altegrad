DIY Dried Flower Bouquet

   If you follow me on Instagram, you’ll know that I’m in a full fledged
   dried flower obsession. It all began when my local florist started
   selling a selection of vibrantly dyed bunny tail grasses. Intrigued by
   these gorgeous fluffy things, I took some home, along with some other
   wonderfully odd dried grasses and before long, my first dried
   arrangement was born.

DIY Ice Dyeing + Giveaway

   Ice dyeing. I’m officially obsessed. This unique method of tie dying
   has been on my to-do list for years – I’m actually surprised it’s taken
   me this long to finally have experimented with it! Zappos, who recently
   just launched a denim shop this fall, was actually the catalyst for
   this long overdue DIY. Did you know that ice dyeing was first conceived
   by quilters who were looking for a resourceful way to dye fabric during
   winter months?

DIY Wrapped & Knotted Wall Hanging

   The idea behind this tutorial is to wrap a cluster of that wonderful
   macrame cotton string, just as we did for the tassel wall hanging, but
   then knot and contort it into a vibrant wall hanging. My favorite part
   about this project is that it’s ever changing. You can form it however
   you desire and then change it up from time to time!

Lelet NY = Fall Hair Goals

   What I love most about fall is the return to classic and beautiful
   clothing. I love how everything feels more streamlined this time of
   year – less trendy, if you will. A woven sweater, a pair of high
   waisted jeans and one far too expensive, yet timeless, coat . . .
   there’s not much else that makes up the perfect fall outfit.

Reyna Noriega

   Artist Reyna Noriega‘s illustrated portraits of women are absolutely
   stunning and empowering. Not only are the compositions compelling, I
   love the way in which she combines muted, cool tones with earthy, warm
   hues.

     * Who says you can’t wear tie dye and hot pink in Fall?! .... I’ve
       been experimenting with ice dyeing and am absolutely obsessed.
       Thanks to @zappos’ newly launched denim shop, I recently got to
       play around with all kinds of white and light washed denim, the
       perfect medium for ice dyeing! It’s amazing what a bag of ice and a
       few ounces of dye can do . . . pure magic. ✨ I encourage you to try
       it! The tutorial is up on HWTF today. Tag your projects with
       #ZapposDenimDIY, @zappos and @honestlywtf and one of you will win a
       $500 Zappos gift card! Deadline is Oct 21st. Good luck and happy
       dyeing!! 🌈 #ad
