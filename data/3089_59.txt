Gotek USB Floppy Emulator

   Similar to the HxC2001, the Gotek USB Floppy Emulator is a direct
   replacement for floppy disk drives. While it may not have the same
   support or confirmed cross-system compatibility as the HxC2001, it has
   since become a strong choice for Commodore Amiga owners following its
   recent firmware release.

   There doesnâ€™t seem to be an official website for the Gotek USB Floppy
   Emulator, however further information is dotted around various blogs.
   With this in mind too, it seems that the best place to get the device
   from is eBay.
     * Storage: USB Memory Sticks
     * Pros: Slim design fits into an Amiga perfectly
     * Cons: Same load times as a floppy disk, lacks the support the
       HxC2001 has
