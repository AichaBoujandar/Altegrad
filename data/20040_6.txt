Female White Rhino for Dubbo Zoo

September 18, 2019

   1_White Rhino calf - 5 days old

   Taronga Western Plains Zoo has welcomed a female White Rhino calf!

   The calf was born, behind-the-scenes, in the early hours of August 18
   to mother, Mopani, at 16 months gestation. The new baby weighed in at
   74kgs.

   â€œThe calf required some initial veterinary assistance over the first
   two days of her life, but being a very strong calf went from strength
   to strength,â€ said Keeper Supervisor Pascale Benoit.

   â€œThe calf is the third offspring for experienced mother Mopani, sired
   by White Rhino bull, Khulu who sadly passed away earlier this year.
   This birth heralds another breeding achievement for the rhino
   conservation breeding programs at Taronga Western Plains Zoo,â€ said
   Pascale.

   Pascale continued, â€œThe team is thrilled to welcome another precious
   White Rhino. Being a female, this little one will one day play an
   important role in the regional breeding program, hopefully creating a
   new genetic bloodline.â€

   Both Mopani and her calf are now on exhibit, along with two other
   females in the herd. Mopani is a very protective and caring mother and
   has bonded well with her calf. She is taking motherhood in her stride
   again.

   â€œWe are really proud of Mopani and the maternal behaviors we are
   observing. She is very protective of her calf and is keeping the other
   herd members at a distance at present,â€ said Pascale.

   NSW Environment Minister, Matt Kean, thanked all the zoo staff for
   their incredible care for the new calf, as well as all the animals at
   Taronga Western Plains Zoo.

   â€œWith about 19,000 White Rhinos left in the wild, every rhino birth is
   vital. It shows how critical the conservation work undertaken by
   Taronga is â€“ not just for rhinos but our native animals that are also
   under threat. These conservation efforts wouldnâ€™t be possible without
   the dedication from zoo staff.â€

   The White Rhino calf is yet to be named. Taronga Western Plains Zoo is
   planning to run a naming competition on its Facebook page to help find
   a name for the newest member of the White Rhino herd.

   Taronga actively supports conservation efforts for wild rhinos in
   Africa, Indonesia and India, including providing funds and support for
   habitat and reforestation, anti-poaching and rhino protection units and
   reduction of human-animal conflict. Taronga is also a founding member
   of the International Rhino Foundation.
