Chocolatey - Software Management for Windows

   Chocolatey Logo

What is Chocolatey?

   Chocolatey is a software management solution unlike anything else
   you've ever experienced on Windows. It focuses on simplicity, security,
   and scalability. You write a software deployment in PowerShell once for
   any software (not just installers), then you can deploy it everywhere
   you have Windows with any solution that can manage systems
   (configuration management, endpoint management, etc) and track and
   manage updates of that software over time. Manage software on-premise,
   in the "Cloud"Â, or in Docker containers with Chocolatey.

   Whew, that was a mouthful! For a bit more detail into what all of that
   means and more, see What is Chocolatey?
