   of her face. On August 31, Berlinâ€™s Panda population doubled as Germany
   welcomed its first-ever Panda offspring â€“ two of them!

   The past month at Zoo Berlin has been particularly tense and exciting,
   with plenty of waiting and crossed fingers. Finally, on August 31 at
   6:54 p.m., the moment everyone had been waiting for arrived: following
   a gestation period of 147 days, female Panda Meng Meng, 6, gave birth
   to her very first cub. The joyous event came just one week after
   experts from Zoo Berlin and the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife
   Research (IZW) were able to perform an ultrasound scan that determined
   Meng Meng was indeed pregnant.

   Immediately after giving birth, the new mother knew just what to do:
   she placed the tiny creature gently on her belly and began to warm it
   lovingly with her big paws, warm breath, and the soft fur of her
   cheeks. But mother and child werenâ€™t alone for long, as at 7:42 p.m. â€“
   just under an hour later â€“ a second cub was born!

   â€œMeng Meng and her two cubs coped well with the birth and are all in
   good health,â€ reports Zoo Director Dr. Andreas Knieriem. â€œEven though
   these are the first offspring born to our young female Panda, she is
   already doing a wonderful job as a mum. In the beginning, the young
   have to feed roughly every two to three hours and are dependent on the
   body heat of their mother to keep warm.â€

   Like all baby Giant Pandas, Germanyâ€™s first Panda cubs were born pink
   with fine white down and a disproportionately large tail. Though they
   are helpless, the youngsters came out with strong lungs and immediately
   put them to good use. Meng Meng responds to their loud squeaks by
   carefully guiding the little ones to her teats to feed. As Pandas that
   give birth to twins usually only raise one of the cubs, in close
   cooperation with Chinese experts of the Chengdu Research Base of Giant
   Panda Breeding Zoo Berlin has decided to actively support Meng Meng in
   the rearing process to ensure the survival of both cubs.

   â€œThere are only 1,864 adult Giant Pandas currently living in their
   natural habitat,â€ says Knieriem. â€œAs a result, every single new cub
   represents an important contribution to the conservation of the
   species.â€ The young Pandas are therefore currently on alternating,
   two-to-three-hour shifts with their mother, and are otherwise being
   cared for in a cozy warm incubator by the Chinese breeding experts.
   Vets have even managed to conduct an initial examination â€“ with
   promising results. At two weeks old, the cubs had more than doubled
   their birth weights to 431 grams (about one pound) and 343 grams
   (roughly 12 ounces). They are nursing so well from Meng Meng that
   supplemental bottle feedings are no longer needed. The cubsâ€™ genders
   have not been determined yet.

   The young Panda family will stay behind the scenes for a while and will
   not be on view to Zoo visitors until further notice. For Panda dad Jiao
   Qing, 9, on the other hand, life goes on as normal. Male Pandas are not
   involved in the rearing of their young, so he can be found relaxing and
   munching on bamboo in the Panda Garden.
