Retroactive 64drive

   At twice the price of the Everdrive 64, the 64drive doesn’t seem to
   offer enough to justify such a hike in price, unless you’re a homebrew
   developer.

   Where it differs from the Everdrive 64 is its combination of a
   CompactFlash and MicroSD card slot, allowing up to a maximum of 160gb
   of storage space. Given that the entire Nintendo 64 ROM set will only
   take up a fraction of this available space, there is little reason to
   even think about investing in such a large memory card for use on the
   64drive.

   Clearly created with homebrew developers in mind (fast USB connectivity
   and large storage space), those more interested in the gaming side of
   flash cards should look towards the cheaper option.
     * Storage: MicroSD and CompactFlash cards
     * Pros: Great compatibility, save game writing, storage space
       potential
     * Cons: Very expensive
