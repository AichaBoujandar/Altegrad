The Podcast- Episode 2: George Harrison

   44 years ago to the day, George Harrison sat down with Howard Smith for
   an interview in NYC. Harrison was only in town for a week, but took the
   time to have this incredible conversation about the Beatles' break-up
   (just 2 weeks earlier), being held back by Paul, his own songwriting
   and plans for his upcoming solo album. That album, "All Things Must
   Pass," will turn out to be hugely successful, holding no. 1 on the
   charts for 7 weeks.
