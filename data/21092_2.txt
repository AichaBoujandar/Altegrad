   Hey Bay Area! There are 2 events in San Francisco next week. There'll

   Come say!

   A great review in PopMatters just came out- Check it out!

   Here's its conclusion:

     Through it all, The Smith Tapes 1969-1972 is a fascinating,
     endlessly readable set of transcripts that read as a sort of
     proto-podcast. That it contains interviews with some of the most
     influential and culturally significant figures of the era discussing
     the work and events for which they would ultimately become best
     known makes The Smith Tapes an indispensable cultural artifact. Like
     his reporting at the time, these interviews offer first-person
     accounts direct from the front lines, delivered in real time and
     without the memory clouding ability of hindsight. To read these
     conversations is to be transported directly into the culture of the
     times. Essential.
