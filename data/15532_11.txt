Choosing the Best VPN Service: How We Ranked & Compared These VPNs

   There are hundreds of VPN services available, and each one claims to be
   perfect for your needs. Choosing the best VPN can be difficult. Our
   in-depth recommendations consider the most important criteria, giving
   you all the information youâ€™ll need to make the right choice.

Security

   Two crucial aspects of a top VPN are privacy and security. Youâ€™ll be
   hard-pressed to find a provider that doesnâ€™t offer them on paper â€“ but
   things can be different in reality.

   A VPN with a verified no-logs policy ensures that your digital
   footprint is secure. No-logs policies mean none of your data is
   collected, stored, or shared while youâ€™re browsing. It protects you
   from prying eyes and preserves your privacy, making it one of the
   leading criteria in our VPN rankings.

Speed

   Another must-have ingredient in the recipe for the best VPN is speed.
   Using a VPN means your traffic is sent through additional servers,
   affecting your speed. Every VPN will slow you down in some way; the
   real question is by how much. The fastest VPN services have the
   smallest impact on your connection quality. Theyâ€™ll let you browse,
   torrent, and stream without annoying lag or buffering.

   A really fast VPN can also help you help you overcome ISP throttling.
   You may end up with faster speeds than you started with.

Streaming

   Speaking of streaming, VPNs are a popular solution for accessing the
   full range of content on platforms like Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, and
   DAZN. Such platforms limit their service depending on your region, but
   connecting to the right VPN server can open the door to your favorite
   shows.

Torrenting

   VPNs are also useful for torrenting fans â€“ especially in countries
   where torrents are prohibited. Even if you follow the rules (we
   recommend you do), torrenting without extra protection can expose you
   to greedy copyright trolls and hackers.

   P2P connections arenâ€™t secure, but you can change that with a good VPN
   for torrenting. By masking your real IP address and hiding your traffic
   behind a layer of encryption, youâ€™ll avoid all the threats that come
   with downloading torrents while enjoying the benefits. In our VPN
   comparison, we checked out torrenting features like P2P profiles,
   SOCKS5 proxies, and easy setup with torrent clients.

Censorship

   Last but not least, letâ€™s talk censorship. You know youâ€™ve landed on a
   reliable provider when your VPN works in a country that actively tries
   to block it. During our research, we looked at special features and
   settings for extra obfuscation. The top VPN services in our overall
   list have proven themselves in censorship-heavy regions like China,
   Iran, and the UAE.

   Many other factors played a significant part in our final rankings.
   These include server network size, encryption, security features, ease
   of use, and of course â€“ price. We spared no expense in exploring every
   detail for our VPN reviews and tests.

Free vs. Paid VPN: Are Free VPNs Safe?

   One could argue that you shouldnâ€™t have to buy your right to online
   privacy. While we agree with this in theory, we also need to face
   reality.

   VPN providers offer a service in exchange for something. And when that
   something isnâ€™t money, itâ€™s usually much worse. Thereâ€™s no such thing
   as truly free: chances are, if youâ€™re not paying for a product, you are
   the product.

   Sadly, most free VPNs have serious limitations, and pose serious
   threats to user privacy and security. From slow speeds and bandwidth
   restrictions to annoying ads and even selling your data, there are
   plenty of valid reasons to avoid free VPNs.

   Take Hola, for example. This free VPN service is essentially a
   glorified proxy that uses peer-to-peer file sharing to reroute usersâ€™
   traffic. Not only is your bandwidth shared, but Hola collects and logs
   almost all the data from your browsing session. Their â€œprivacy policyâ€
   even specifies that it will share your data with third parties,
   affiliates, and partners.

   Not all free VPNs are bad. We rigorously tested dozens of free
   services, and found some free VPNs which are safe to use. But is that
   enough?

   When you look at the extra value paid VPNs offer, you probably wonâ€™t
   want a free service. Itâ€™s simple â€“ if you want a provider that will
   guarantee your privacy and give you the servers and features you need,
   itâ€™s better to pay a few bucks than end up disappointed with a free
   VPN.

   Keep in mind that you can bring down the overall cost of a paid VPN
   considerably by taking advantage of discount deals and coupon codes.
   That way, you can get a premium service for pocket change â€“ a win-win
   situation!

   Many top VPN services also offer free trials so you can test out their
   service for free. Most offer money-back guarantees as well, so you can
   have a risk-free test period to make sure youâ€™re happy with the
   service.

Is a VPN Legal to Use?

   Because VPNs can be used to facilitate illegal activities, many believe
   the software itself is against the law. This isnâ€™t true.

   Itâ€™s legal to use a VPN in 95.9% of countries. Using a VPN is illegal
   (or falls in a gray area) in:
     * China
     * Iraq
     * Iran
     * Russia
     * Belarus
     * Turkey
     * Oman
     * UAE

   Using a VPN is a common practice. Many companies use them to protect
   sensitive data, decrease the risk of hacking, and to perform market
   research in different countries.

   Hiding behind a VPN while engaging in criminal acts is illegal. But
   this isnâ€™t a problem with the VPN itself â€“ especially when millions are
   using these services for security and privacy.

Is it Safe to Use a VPN?

   VPNs are safe to use in most countries. However, itâ€™s your
   responsibility to make sure you follow the rules and stay out of
   trouble.

   However, you may be taking a risk if:
     * You use a non-government-permitted VPN in a country where the
       government mandates which VPNs are allowed
     * You torrent copyrighted material with a VPN that keeps logs or
       doesnâ€™t have a kill switch.

How Do I Use a VPN?

   Nowadays, using a VPN is as simple as downloading the software from
   your providerâ€™s website and installing it. Setup usually takes just a
   couple of minutes.

   Most VPN services are user-friendly, with intuitive interfaces and
   straightforward instructions. All you need to do is select a secure
   server from the list â€“ or let the VPN app choose an optimal location if
   it has a quick-connect feature.

   If you donâ€™t have any experience with VPNs, donâ€™t worry! Itâ€™s much
   easier than it sounds â€“ especially if you catch up with our detailed
   beginnerâ€™s guide.

How Much Does a VPN Cost? Can I Get a Good Cheap VPN?

   Thankfully, premium VPNs donâ€™t come at premium prices. While monthly
   subscriptions are expensive, investing in a long-term plan means youâ€™ll
   probably pay the equivalent of $3 â€“ $7 per month.

   In fact, you can actually get a top-quality VPN service for less than
   $3/month!

   Itâ€™s also worth noting that many VPNs offer free trials, so you can
   test if their service meets your safety and streaming needs.

   Most also have money-back guarantee refund policies. Depending on which
   service you choose, youâ€™ll have between 7 â€“ 45 days to cancel your
   service risk-free if youâ€™re not happy.

   You can also save on your subscription by using our deals and coupon
   codes.

Can I Use Tor or a Proxy Instead of a VPN?

   Tor, proxies, and VPNs are three completely different types of software
   that sometimes serve the same use. Letâ€™s take a closer look.

   Tor (short for The Onion Router) utilizes an anonymizing network that
   bounces your connection through several volunteer servers. While this
   process makes you (and your data) much harder to track, it will slow
   you down. Tor is a very complex topic, so check out our ultimate guide
   to Tor if youâ€™re curious for more info and tips.

   Compared to VPNs, Tor has its drawbacks. While itâ€™s free to use, it
   provides weaker encryption and slower connections. The best move is to
   use both Tor and a VPN together and reap all the benefits. A stable VPN
   removes Torâ€™s weaknesses, while Tor improves your privacy even further.

   That said, not all VPNs are compatible with Tor. To make it work, you
   need a VPN like NordVPN which offers specialized Tor over VPN servers.

   Proxy services have one advantage over VPNs: they offer fast speeds
   (and hide your IP address). However, they have no other security
   features, donâ€™t encrypt your data, and donâ€™t even offer an interface.

   These features mean proxies are not secure or easy to use. However,
   they can improve your connection speeds if privacy isnâ€™t a concern for
   you.

   There are hundreds of proxies out there, so itâ€™s important to choose
   the right one. Better yet, invest in a fast, cheap VPN and benefit from
   extra protection and privacy on top of great speeds.

   Note: We at vpnMentor provide a free proxy tool! Feel free to use it if
   youâ€™re in a hurry and donâ€™t have time to pick and choose.

Whatâ€™s the Best VPN for My Device/Software/Operating System?

   The same VPN service can have several different versions depending on
   which platform itâ€™s designed for. For example, even if your VPN is
   flawless on Windows, its mobile app may be broken and unstable on your
   phone.

   In truth, there isnâ€™t a VPN provider thatâ€™s universally best for every
   device, software, or operating system. In order to make the right
   choice, youâ€™ll need to do some research and find the top-rated VPNs for
   your needs.
