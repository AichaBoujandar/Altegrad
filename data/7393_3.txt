   Debi Traub is exactly like her food photography â€” fun, colorful, full
   of life, and ready to jump off the page at any given moment. As
   intricate and masterful as her food presentation appears, her recipes
   are actually simple and doable, even for someone like me who is not
   anything close to a chef. Debi also approaches everything with
   positivity and a sense of humor that makes you want to take the journey
   with her and think you can do it too

   The name â€œSimply Beautiful Eatingâ€ really says it all. Debiâ€™s
   straight-forward recipes, gorgeous photos and fun glimpses into her
   kitchen will have you wishing you were in the kitchen helping out or
   your elbows on the counter eagerly waiting to lick the frosting off the
   whisk! When we work with Debi, I rest easy knowing everything will be
   delivered on time and sheâ€™ll have provided a crowd-pleasing recipe for
   our partners. And while she may be best known her baked goodies, donâ€™t
   let all those sweets fool you, her savoury stuff is fantastic too!
