Super Flash Card 64M

   Before the days of SD card enabled flash cartridges, Tototek ruled the
   retro gaming world with their range of flash cartridges. These fabled
   devices featured enough space for four different games to be loaded
   onto the on-board memory, however, they had to be programmed on using a
   pre-historic parallel port - something that hasnâ€™t been seen on PCs for
   a good decade.
