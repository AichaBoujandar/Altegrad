Powerpak

   The Powerpak is a Nintendo NES flash cartridge created by RetroZone.
   The cartridge reads Nintendo NES ROMs off a CompactFlash card. While
   not all games are currently compatible with the device, updates are
   often released to support more complicated mappers.
     * Storage: CompactFlash Cards
     * Pros: Only the currently available Nintendo NES flash cartridge to
       date
     * Cons: The device is very fussy as to which CompactFlash cards will
       work with it
