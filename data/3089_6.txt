Super UFO Pro 8

   The Super UFO Pro 8 was China’s answer to the Super Everdrive. Having
   once been the experts on playing Super Nintendo ROMs via other means
   (thanks to their outdated Floppy Disk based devices of the 90s), you’d
   really expect their experience with these products to shine through.

   Apart from the impressive, albeit flaky (read: doesn’t work with every
   game) addition of save states on the original hardware (pause a game
   anywhere, turn off the device, resume play another time at exactly the
   same point) and the ability to backup games and saves from retail
   cartridges, the rest of the device feels somewhat unfinished. Unlike
   the Super Everdrive, additional software is required on your PC, an
   original Super Nintendo cartridge needs to be connected above before
   any games will load, and file names over 8 characters are shortened in
   the ROM loading menu.

   A lot of talk, but no action.
     * Storage: SD cards
     * Pros: Save state functionality is great on the games it does work
       with
     * Cons: Horrible software requirement, awful menu system, unfulfilled
       promises
