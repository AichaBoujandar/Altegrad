Watara / Quickshot Supervision

Mateos Watara Rewritable Multigame Cartridge 8 in 1

   The Supervision is an odd handheld, originally pitched as a cheaper
   alternative to the Game Boy. While it did exactly what it promised, the
   low quality releases for the system meant that it didn’t last long.

   As of today those still feeling fond of the system can rest assured
   knowing there’s a flash cartridge available for the system. The Mateos
   Watara Rewritable Multigame Cartridge 8 in 1 can be written to with a
   USB linker, with space for up to eight different games. Although
   limited, this rewritable cartridge is the only of its kind available
   for the Supervision and incredibly cheap too. Once coupled with the
   required USB linker, you’ll be spending no more than 47 Euros including
   postage to get yours.

   The most quirky aspect to this device is that the games have to be
   selected through twisting a dial on flash cartridge itself. An added
   bonus of the kit too is that the same creator has made Atari Lynx and
   Vectrex cartridges too, meaning you only need the one USB linker.
     * Storage: Rewritable Flash Memory
     * Pros: Only one of its kind, cheap and shared USB linker
     * Cons: Limited storage space, unusual game selection method
