Monolithic Power Systems (MPS) MP2153 Synchronous Step-Down Converter

   Monolithic Power Systems (MPS) MP2153 Synchronous Step-Down Converter
   achieves offers 1.5A of continuous output current with excellent load
   and line regulation over a 4V to 36V input supply range. The output
   voltage of the MP2153 can be regulated as low as 0.6V. The Constant On
   Time (COT) control scheme provides fast transient response and eases
   loop stabilization. By using input voltage feed-forward, the MP2153
   maintains a fairly constant switching frequency across the input and
   output voltage ranges.
