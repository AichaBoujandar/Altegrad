Chocolatey Styleguide

Learn how to use the official Chocolatey Theme to create standalone projects
which reflect the Chocolatey Brand.

   IMPORTANT!
   Please read through this Chocolatey Styleguide before starting a
   project that is meant to use the Chocolatey Theme.

Getting Started Quick

   The Chocolatey Theme uses Bootstrap v4.3.1 as its underlying framework,
   and extends it with custom styles. This Chocolatey Styleguide is meant
   to be used in conjuction with the Bootstrap Documentation and only
   covers components that have been extended from Bootstrap to fit
   Chocolatey's style needs. Therefor, if an item you are searching for is
   not listed in this Chocolatey Styleguide, it is safe to say this theme
   is using the default assets covered by Bootstrap, and should be
   referenced there.
   Download Chocolatey Theme Files

CSS

   After downloading the Chocolatey resources above, include either the
   "chocolatey.slim.css" (recomended) OR "chocolatey.css" <link> into your
   <head> before all other stylesheets. The "chocolatey.slim.css" file
   contains only the css classes needed to style a basic website, nothing
   more (this is what Chocolatey.org is using!). If for some reason this
   slim version is not fitting the needs of your project, instead include
   the full build "chocolatey.css". Both files include Bootstrap CSS
   v4.3.1 and custom styles to extend Bootstrap.

JavaScript

   Many of Bootstrap's componets require JavaScript to function at their
   full potential. After downloading the Chocolatey resources above, place
   the following <script> near the end of your pages, right before the
   closing </body> tag. This bundled file contains jQuery v3.3.1,
   Bootstrap JS v4.3.1, Popper.js v1, Clipboard.js, and custom features to
   extend the Chocolatey Theme. Do not include these files seperately in
   your project!
<script src="/js/chocolatey.js"></script>

<!-- Optional JS for use of Syntax Highlighting -->
<script src="/js/prism.js"></script>
