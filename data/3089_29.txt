Saroo

   Around the same time the Rhea was announced, China also had an answer
   to loading backups of Sega Saturn games. Unlike the Rhea, the Saroo is
   a cartridge which slots into the back of the console - requiring no
   installation or modification.

   As good as this sounds, the team behind the device have been missing in
   action since late 2014. Whether or not the device was discontinued or
   ever finished remains to be known.
