   Sir Lucian Grainge is made a Knight Bachelor of the British Empire by
   the Duke of Cambridge at Buckingham Palace in London.

   Universal Music Group chairman and CEO Lucian Grainge was honored on
   Tuesday during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace in London. Prince
   William, the Duke of Cambridge, donned his knightly sword and
   inaugurated Sir Lucian's appointment to the Order of the British Empire
   and Knight Bachelor for his accomplishments in the music business.

   The knighthood was first announced in June as part of Queen Elizabeth
   II's 90th birthday honors. "It is with enormous pride that I receive
   this honor from Her Majesty the Queen," he said at the time. "It is a
   recognition of British music's significance to the U.K.'s culture and
   economy, its role in inspiring investment, and the contribution of
   incredible creative talent from around the world." [readmore:6874748]

   UMG, owned by Vivendi, is having a good year. In the first nine months,
   UMG revenues were up 3.8 percent to $4 billion, with streaming alone
   accounting for a quarter of that. Grainge, a former A&R executive who
   worked with acts from Eurythmics to Amy Winehouse, was recognized as
   the top executive on this year's Billboard Power 100 list.
