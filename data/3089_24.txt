Everdrive MD

   Krikzz’s very first entry into the world of flash cartridges was the
   Everdrive MD. Built from the ground up for his favourite console, the
   Everdrive MD was a fantastic solution to enjoying the Mega Drive
   library on a single cartridge. This is made even better by the fact
   that the Everdrive MD can also boot up Master System and 32X games on
   the Mega Drive. Furthermore, the Everdrive MD is also capable of
   temporarily changing the BIOS on your Mega CD, allowing you to load
   imported game discs with ease.

   Over time the device has had a number of firmware updates and further
   compatibility improvements (EA games and others), however, in terms of
   pure power there’s a newer alternative that eclipses it - the Mega
   Everdrive. That said if all you’re looking for is a quick and cheap way
   of accessing a wealth of Mega Drive games from one place, the Everdrive
   MD is for you.
