Neo Geo Pocket Flashmasta

   Although the Neo Geo Pocket may have one of the smallest gaming
   libraries around, its fan base is pretty loyal and dedicated to the
   device. This in turn has seen the arrival of the Neo Geo Flashmasta and
   linker - a rewritable flash cartridge with its own USB writer.

   Unfortunately the creator behind this device recently discontinued the
   cartridge linker, meaning those wanting to pick one up will need to
   look for secondhand units. That said it was discontinued for a good
   reason - the creator believes he has devised a much better method of
   writing to the cartridge that will be included in a newer version
   thatâ€™s yet to be released.
