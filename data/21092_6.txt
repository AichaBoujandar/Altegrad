The Podcast- Episode 1

Lou Reed

   This month celebrates what would have been Lou Reed's 72nd birthday. It
   also marks the 45th anniversary of his interview with Howard Smith
   (March 26, 1969). It was a rare interview to say the least,
   finding Reed upon the release of the Velvet Underground's incredible
   3rd album (The Velvet Underground)  and in the midst of a sobriety
   kick.
   In the podcast we also hear from Howard Smith himself, who talks about
   his experiences with Reed at the time.
