Drag ‘N Derp

   Removing the need for bundled software and horrific drivers, the Drag
   ‘N Derp does exactly what it says on the tin. Simply connect the
   cartridge to your PC with a USB cable, it will appear as a removable
   drive, drop the Game Boy ROM you want (and .SAV file) onto the device,
   disconnect and go play. Simple.

   Although offering the most straightforward and admirable form of
   writing ROMs to a Game Boy cartridge we’ve seen to date, the Drag ‘N
   Derp cartridge is limited to a single Game Boy ROM at any one time.

   If you don’t mind connecting up and loading different ROMs on each time
   you want to play then the Drag ‘N Derp is for you. Those wanting a
   larger selection of games for long journeys and convenience will need
   to look elsewhere.
     * Storage: On-board memory (24MBit) for one game
     * Pros: Very easy to use
     * Cons: Expensive, lack of ability to store and run multiple games
