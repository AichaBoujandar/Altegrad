Major exhibitions at the Musée de l’Orangerie from the 1930s to the 1950s

   The Musée National de l’Orangerie des Tuileries was attached to the
   Louvre in 1930. The western half of the building, next to the Place de
   la Concorde, was thus transformed into a series of four rooms intended
   for the temporary exhibitions of the national museums, which marked a
   new chapter in its history. A series of magnificent exhibitions were
   held every year: a cycle on the Impressionists from 1930 to 1933, the
   exhibition dedicated to the 17th century Peintres de la réalité
   [Painters of Reality] in 1934 which has become legendary, Rubens et son
   temps [Rubens and His Age] which attracted a million visitors in 1936,
   and Degas in 1937. In 1942 an exhibition was held dedicated to Arno
   Breker, a German sculptor who studied in France and who became an
   official artist of the Third Reich. The masterpieces of French private
   collections recovered in Germany by the French Commission for Art
   Recovery and the allies, the Monuments Men, were displayed here in
   1946.

   In 1945, the Orangerie, along with the Jeu de Paume which housed the
   Impressionist collections of the Louvre, formed a single entity
   attached to the Paintings Department of the Louvre Museum. The Réunion
   des Musées Nationaux continued to organise major exhibitions here from
   1946 to 1960 which proved highly successful, such as Van Gogh et les
   peintres d’Auvers-sur-Oise [Van Gogh and The Painters of
   Auvers-sur-Oise] and De David à Toulouse-Lautrec [From David to
   Toulouse-Lautrec] in 1954 and 1955... This led to in the construction
   of the Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, which opened in 1964.
