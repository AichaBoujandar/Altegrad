How to Start a Blog From Scratch â€“ A Comprehensive Guide

   Unless youâ€™ve been hiding under a rock for the past decade or so,
   youâ€™ve probably noticed the sudden increase in blogging websites.

   Regardless of the nature of your business, setting up a web presence is
   more important than ever before. And once youâ€™ve got your website in
   place, youâ€™ll need a blog to go with it â€“ after all, blogging is
   perhaps one of the most powerful tools you can leverage to boost sales,
   attract new customers and build brand credibility with existing
   clients.

   Let me start off by saying that you donâ€™t need to be programming
   literate to follow this practical guide â€“ in fact, you wonâ€™t have to

   say â€œFear not, for this guide is with you.â€

   Iâ€™ll walk you through five simple steps to help you launch your blog:
    1. Choose a Blogging Platform
