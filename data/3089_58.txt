HxC2001

   The incredibly versatile and oddly named HxC2001 is a direct
   replacement for just about any floppy disk drive. By simply hijacking a
   system’s floppy disk cable, the device can pretend to be a connected
   disk drive loading floppy images from SD card. The device also have a
   built-in display to show which image is currently present in memory,
   along with hardware buttons to switch between what’s available.

   With a wide range of compatible computers and devices (and musical
   keyboards too), the HxC2001 is an incredible multi-system solution to
   floppy disk loading. Furthermore, some of the compatible systems have
   menu-interfaces at the ready, allowing you to choose your desired game
   images through the computer itself.
