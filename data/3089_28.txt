Sega Saturn Optical Drive Replacements

Rhea

   This oddly named hardware add-on for the Sega Saturn is set to make
   your discs obsolete. This credit card sized device completely replaces
   the console’s disc drive, and sends the information from game discs
   into the console’s memory. This in turn allows you to store a wide
   selection of games within the console, all of which load even faster
   from SD card.

   While it does require some additional installation, and a small
   modification depending on which version motherboard your Saturn has,
   you’ll be hard pressed to find anything better. The creator of this
   device has also created a disc drive emulator for the Sega Dreamcast
   too which is as equally as impressive.

   Obtaining the Rhea, however, is a bit of a challenge. The creator is
   often flooded with requests for the device and often sold out. That
   said, keep an eye on the official website for further updates.
     * Storage: SD Cards
     * Pros: Perfect Compatibility, Fast Loading
     * Cons: Requires installation by opening up your console, no built-in
       menu software
