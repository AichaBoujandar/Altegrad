   Our Mission

   Story Book Farm is a place of safety. We offer freedom from fear. We
   are a place of healing and recovery from trauma. We believe that all
   animals have rights; that animals have the right to live free of fear
   or pain from humans, in any form;  and that we can all make a
   difference, one being at a time. In sanctuary care, we encourage
   friendships between our residents. We encourage exploration and freedom
   of choice. We give back the ability to make decisions and control
   events that affect residents' lives.

   As of 2019-04-23, we are home to 19 monkeys who have come to us for
   peace and solace from a variety of backgrounds, some of them with
   stories difficult even to share, let alone survive.

   Won't you join us in our mission? Donate or volunteer today! The
   rewards are immeasurable.

   Thank you to everyone who has supported us in the past.  We hope you
   will continue to do so in the future, and spread the word so that our
   community of supporters continues to grow!
