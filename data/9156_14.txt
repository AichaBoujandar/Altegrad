SCPro™ Level Three

Level Three: Initiation of Supply Chain Transformation

   The highest SCPro™ designation requires an unprecedented use of
   practical application, a groundbreaking advance among supply chain
   certifications. Candidates must perform hands-on analysis of a working
   organization and create a detailed project plan that generates real
   results, such as increased ROI or improved cycle times. However, Level
   Three is not limited to an independent project. Candidates are paired
   with an academic advisor who serves as a mentor throughout this
   process, then are evaluated by a panel of supply chain experts. Level
   Three SCPros™ are true leaders who have proven their worth.
