Mara Hoffman Bridal Spring 2015

   Silk georgette and chiffon gowns with intricate beading,
   embroidered embellishments, braided fringe and subtle cutouts . . .
   leave it to Mara Hoffman to dream up a yet another non conventional,
   yet absolutely stunning collection of wedding dresses. Dresses as
   beautiful as ones with shimmering bodices, entirely beaded and so
   beautifully extended past the waist, make me wanna get married all over
   again.

     * Who says you canâ€™t wear tie dye and hot pink in Fall?! .... Iâ€™ve
       been experimenting with ice dyeing and am absolutely obsessed.
       Thanks to @zapposâ€™ newly launched denim shop, I recently got to
       play around with all kinds of white and light washed denim, the
       perfect medium for ice dyeing! Itâ€™s amazing what a bag of ice and a
       few ounces of dye can do . . . pure magic. âœ¨ I encourage you to try
       it! The tutorial is up on HWTF today. Tag your projects with
       #ZapposDenimDIY, @zappos and @honestlywtf and one of you will win a
       $500 Zappos gift card! Deadline is Oct 21st. Good luck and happy
       dyeing!! ðŸŒˆ #ad
