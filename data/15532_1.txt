Report: Data Breach in Adult Site Compromises Privacy of All Users

   Last updated on 21st August 2019

   Led by Noam Rotem and Ran Locar, vpnMentorâ€™s research team discovered a
   data breach in adult site Luscious.

   Luscious is a niche pornographic image site focused primarily on
   animated, user-uploaded content. Based on the research carried out by
   our team, the site has over 1 million registered users. Each user has a
   profile, the details of which could be accessed through our research.

   Private profiles allow users to upload, share, comment on, and discuss
   content on Luscious. All of this is understandably done while keeping
   their identity hidden behind usernames.

   The data breach our team discovered compromises this anonymity by
   potentially allowing hackers to access the personal details of users,
   including their personal email address. The highly sensitive and
   private nature of Lusciousâ€™ content makes users incredibly vulnerable
   to a range of attacks and exploitation by malicious hackers.

Timeline of Discovery and Owner Reaction

     * Date discovered: 15/08/19
     * Date owner contacted: 16/08/19

Example of Entries in the Database

   The data breach gave our team access to 1.195 million user accounts on
   Luscious. All of these were compromised, revealing personal details of
   users with potentially devastating consequences.

   The private personal user details we viewed included:
     * Usernames
     * Personal email addresses
     * User activity logs (date joined, most recent log in)
     * Country of residence/location
     * Gender

   Some usersâ€™ email addresses indicated their full names, increasing
   their vulnerability to exploitation and cybercrime.

   Itâ€™s worth mentioning that we estimate 20% of emails on Luscious
   accounts use fake email addresses to sign up. This suggests that some
   Luscious users are actively taking extra steps to remain anonymous.

User Behaviours & Activities

   The data breach also gave a complete overview of user activities. This
   allowed us to view things like:
     * The number of image albums they had created
     * Video uploads
     * Comments
     * Blog posts
     * Favorites
     * Followers and accounts followed
     * Their User ID number â€“ so we can know if theyâ€™re active or have
       been banned

   While some of this information is visible to other users, much of it
   was hidden in the websiteâ€™s database. All of this combined information
   creates valuable insights into how people use Luscious.

   Our team was also able to view details of blog posts and content
   published on Luscious. This included the authorâ€™s details, along with
   the number of likes, when published, category, etc.

   Some of these blog posts were extremely personal â€“ including depressive
   or otherwise vulnerable content â€“ and kept anonymous. Due to this data
   breach, however, the blog posts are no longer anonymous, with many of
   the authorsâ€™ identities revealed.

   Likewise, for images uploaded to Luscious, we gained access an index of
   pictures with detailed information, including who created them.

   The 1 million+ users affected are located around the world, with their
   locations also revealed in the breach. During our research, we were
   able to access user profiles from Europe, Asia, Australia, and the
   Americas.

   For example, we found approximately 13,000 email addresses in â€œ.frâ€,
   representing about 1.25% of the database. Considering the number of
   French people who use email hosting like Gmail â€“ ending in â€œ.comâ€ and
   based on the French names we saw on @gmail.com addresses- we estimate
   the actual number of French users to be around 3 times higher:
   approximately 40,000.

   Below is a table outlining the international distribution of Luscious
   users, based on email addresses and our estimations of real numbers,
   considering Gmail accounts and Similarweb stats.
    Country Our estimation of users based on the email addresses found in
   the DB
    France   40,000
    Netherlands  8,000
    Sweden  6,000
    Germany  50,000
    Spain  7,000
    Russia  35,000
    Israel  1,000
    Italy  18,000
    Brazil  10,000
    Canada  15,000
    Australia  5,000
    Poland  20,000
    Japan  6,000
    India  6,000

   A greater issue of concern is the fact that many users joined Luscious
   on official government emails. We found examples of this from users in
   Brazil, Australia, Italy, Malaysia, and Australia.
   Domain Our estimation of users based on the email addresses found in
   the DB
   .edu  Less than a thousand
   .gov  Dozens

   This adds a great deal of additional vulnerability not just to the
   users, but also their employers. With access to employee email
   addresses, criminal hackers can target government agencies and
   departments in a number of ways.

Data Breach Impact

   The impact of this data breach on users could be devastating,
   personally and financially. Activity on adult sites like Luscious is
   the most private in nature, and nobody ever expects it to be
   revealed.

   Its exposure could be ruinous for a victimâ€™s relationships and personal
   lives.

   The information made available in Lusciousâ€™ databases gives criminal
   and malicious hackers many options to use this data for illicit gains
   and exploiting users.

Doxing

   Doxing refers to the act of investigating an internet userâ€™s identity
   and making it public, usually with malicious intent. With access to
   Luscious usersâ€™ email addresses and locations, hackers could easily
   locate their profiles on social media and similar sites.

   With this information, a Luscious user is at risk of being publicly
   exposed for their activity on the website. They could be targeted for
   harassment, bullying, or having the details shared with their family,
   friends, and employers.

   Given the nature of the content on Luscious, the effects of such a
   campaign could be devastating.

Extortion

   Once a Luscious userâ€™s identity is compromised, they can be targeted
   for more than just bullying. Hackers could threaten to expose users
   unless they pay a ransom. Given the sensitive nature of this data
   breach, victims are incredibly vulnerable and likely to pay.

   However, paying a ransom does not guarantee your details wonâ€™t be
   revealed anyway. Once this data is stolen, it can be used and sold over
   and over again. This leaves users open to ongoing extortion from one
   hacker, with potential for their Luscious activity to still be leaked
   by another.

Phishing

   Phishing refers to the creation of imitation emails sent to victims to
   trick them into providing passwords or other compromising information,
   giving access to financial accounts or credit cards, and embedding
   malware on a device.

   A hacker or cybercriminal sends a target an email made to look like a
   legitimate business or organization that the victim already uses, to
   extract the desired information or plant malware.

   By revealing personal details like email addresses and location, the
   Luscious data breach helps criminals target users for future
   exploitation, fraud, or theft. They can use this information to create
   effective fraudulent emails and send them directly to a userâ€™s email
   inbox â€“ that way, they also stand out from spam and junk mail.

Competitor Actions

   This data breach also makes Luscious vulnerable. With over 1 million
   users and over 20 million visits per month, itâ€™s a leading website
   within its niche. Itâ€™s also no doubt very profitable.

   With the private information now revealed, Lusciousâ€™ competitors can
   also analyze user behavior â€“ their favorites, what they like, how they
   interact with other users â€“ and target them with better alternatives.
   Usually, online businesses keep all this information securely hidden,
   as it presents a huge risk to their business model and revenue.

Advice from the Experts

   This data leak could have easily been avoided if Luscious had taken
   some basic security measures. These can be replicated by any company,
   no matter its size:
    1. Secure your servers.
    2. Implement proper access rules.
    3. Never leave a system that doesnâ€™t require authentication open to
       the internet.

For Users

   We suggest you immediately change your Luscious account details,
   including your username and associated email address.

   For adult-themed websites, or any other websites of a sensitive nature,
   always create a username completely unrelated to your personal email
   address or any other online account.

   If you have revealed your location on Luscious, remove this detail from
   your profile. You can also change your location using a VPN.

   To learn more about your internet privacy in general, and how to avoid
   data breaches like this one in your life and business, read our
   complete guide to online privacy.

How and Why We Discovered the Breach

   The vpnMentor research team discovered the breach in Lusciousâ€™s
   databases as part of a huge web mapping project. Our hackers use port
   scanning to examine particular IP blocks and test open holes in systems
   for weaknesses. They examine each hole for data being leaked.

   When they find a data breach, they use expert techniques to verify the
   databaseâ€™s identity. We then alert the company to the breach. If
   possible, we will also alert those affected by the breach.

   Our team was able to access this database because it was completely
   unsecured and unencrypted.

   The company uses an Elasticsearch database, which is ordinarily not
   designed for URL use. However, we were able to access it via browser
   and manipulate the URL search criteria into exposing schemata from a
   single index at any time.

   The purpose of this web mapping project is to help make the internet
   safer for all users.

   As ethical hackers, weâ€™re obliged to inform a company when we discover
   flaws in their online security. This is especially true when the
   companies data breach contains such private information.

   However, these ethics also mean we carry a responsibility to the
   public. Luscious users must be aware of a data breach that impacts them
   also.

   Finding the best VPN to keep you safe online feels impossible. There
   are hundreds of VPNs out there, and each one claims itâ€™s the best.

   At vpnMentor, weâ€™ve so far tested more than 300 VPNs for speed,
   security, support, and features. We analyzed stacks of data and skipped
   the biased reviews. Instead, we ran our own tests to bring you a list
   of the top 10 services.

   We even made some calls to Google and PayPal to investigate rumors
   surrounding some VPNs. We also delisted several shady VPNs: while they
   hadnâ€™t yet been caught sharing user data, weâ€™re worried that soon, they
   will.

   We found that while some small VPNs lack the marketing budgets of some
   of the bigger brands, they were able to outperform some of the big
   boys.

   On the other hand, we found that some of the more popular VPNs are
   actually quite worthless â€“ and even dangerous â€“ when put through
   rigorous testing.

   We can honestly say that after this testing process, weâ€™re certain that
   our top 10 VPNs will keep you safe, protect your data, and give you
   lightning-fast streaming speeds.

Here Are 2019â€™s Best VPN Providers â€“ Reviewed & Compared

1. NordVPN

   Ranked as the #1 VPN in 2019

     * Dedicated torrenting profile: Yes, P2P specialty servers available
     * Works with: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, HBO GO, Amazon Prime Video,
       Showtime, Sling TV
     * Available on: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, BlackBerry,
       Routers, Raspberry Pi, Android TV, Chrome, Firefox
     * Data logging: Strict no-logs policy

   NordVPN is our #1 VPN recommendation. It provides exceptional
   all-around value, with great features and performance at a price few
   can beat.

   AES-256 encryption and support for OpenVPN and IKEv2/IPSec protocols
   keep your traffic secure and hidden. Since itâ€™s registered in Panama,
   NordVPN is also far away from Fourteen Eyes surveillance and troubling
   data retention laws. This allows it to collect zero sensitive user logs
   â€“ great news for the privacy-conscious.

   The massive NordVPN network has over 5,400 servers in 60+ countries,
   with regular new additions. It offers specialty servers for P2P, double
   encryption, dedicated IPs, and Onion over VPN for Tor users.

   Secure streaming and torrenting are one-click tasks with NordVPN.
   Thanks to proprietary SmartPlay DNS settings, the NordVPN client
   automatically provides reliable access and fast speeds when you open
   Netflix and other streaming services.

   The CyberSec suite is another unique NordVPN feature. It provides
   adblocking and extra malware protection. Advanced obfuscation settings
   ensure the VPN works in countries with heavy censorship such as China.
   Plus, you donâ€™t have to worry about VPN leaks as NordVPN offers two
   different kill switches and custom DNS settings to prevent them.

   If you ever need assistance, you can count on the 24/7 live chat
   customer support to help you out. Whatâ€™s more, NordVPN has a huge
   knowledge base full of useful info on setups and servers.

   Donâ€™t Use If:
     * You want to pay with PayPal.

   The bottom line? We think NordVPN is the ultimate multi-purpose VPN,
   but we were disappointed that you canâ€™t pay with PayPal. You can test
   its intuitive apps and excellent features on six devices with a
   risk-free 30-day money-back guarantee.
