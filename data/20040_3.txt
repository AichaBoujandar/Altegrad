   In spite of their name, the babies are only a few inches long right
   now. The Aquarium's experts are caring for these tiny reptiles behind
   the scenes in a special Gecko nursery.

   The Aquariumâ€™s herpetology team says the pair are currently growing
   well and â€œeating like champs.â€

   The Madagascar Giant Day Gecko has a bright green body with brilliant
   red markings. The red markings fade as the Gecko ages, so the adults
   are mostly green in color. In the wild, these Geckos feed on insects,
   small reptiles, nectar and pollen. Adults can grow to around 12 inches
   in length.

   Geckos are a type of Lizard. Madagascar Giant Day Geckos are native to
   the tropical forests of northern Madagascar, and a few other locations
   to which they have been introduced by humans.

   Madagascar Giant Day Geckos are rumored to be the inspiration for the
   Geico Gecko of advertising fame.
