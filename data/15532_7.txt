7. Hotspot Shield

   Reliable protection and easy streaming
     * Dedicated torrenting profile: No
     * Works with: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime Video
     * Available on: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Chrome
     * Data logging: Yes (keeps connection logs for the duration of VPN
       sessions, as well as data for marketing purposes)

   Hotspot Shield’s paid VPN – known as Hotspot Shield Premium – includes
   access to more than 2,500 worldwide servers, as well as elegant apps
   and fast speeds. Does that make it worth the cost?

   We’d say so. This VPN is a solid choice for both casual and power
   users, providing excellent security on with 128-bit/256-bit encryption
   and proprietary Catapult Hydra protocol (based on OpenSSL).

   Hotspot Shield compresses data during streaming for optimized Netflix
   access and buffer-free streaming.

   For features, you get the essential kill switch and not much else. You
   won’t find custom DNS settings or extra help for torrenting. Although
   P2P traffic is allowed, you’d be better off with another VPN on this
   list if torrenting is a priority for you.

   That’s because, despite its excellent overall performance, Hotspot
   Shield isn’t a no-logs VPN service. Combined with the U.S.
   jurisdiction, this could make you an easy target for copyright trolls
   or DMCA requests – especially if you’re a US resident.

   Don’t Use If:
     * You need a VPN for torrenting.

   Even though Hotspot Shield has its drawbacks, it remains a popular,
   powerful, and affordable VPN service. We recommend taking it for a test
   drive with the 45-day money-back guarantee.
