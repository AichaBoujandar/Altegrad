   Great apps and stable speeds
     * Dedicated torrenting profile: No
     * Works with: Netflix, BBC iPlayer
     * Available on: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Windows Phone,
       Routers, Chromebook, Amazon Fire TV
     * Data logging: Strict no-logs policy

   The balance between security and performance makes IPVanish another top
   VPN pick. With 1,200+ servers, decent unblocking powers, and reliable
   protection, this provider has a lot to offer.

   256-bit encryption and a variety of VPN protocols – including OpenVPN –
   make IPVanish secure. A kill switch and DNS/IPv6 leak protection ensure
   you’re always protected.

   Speeds are fast and reliable, so you don’t have to worry about annoying
   connection drops or stability issues. What’s more, IPVanish recently
   improved its Netflix servers, making it reliable for streaming.

   IPVanish supports P2P connections and SOCKS5 proxies for fast torrent
   downloads. Although IPVanish is US-based (which would usually subject
   it to DMCA requests), it operates a legitimate zero-logging policy – so
   the US jurisdiction shouldn’t be an issue for torrenting fans.

   IPVanish also provides extra obfuscation settings and additional IP
   configuration like reset intervals. These features, along with the 24/7
   customer support and 10 simultaneous connections, make it stand out
   from many other VPN services. We wish the refund period were a little
   longer, but a 7-day money-back guarantee is still better than nothing.

   Don’t Use If:
     * You are looking for a cheap VPN.

   IPVanish isn’t the cheapest provider around, but the price is right for
   the great value this VPN provides.
