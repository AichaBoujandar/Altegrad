Mateos Atari Lynx Rewritable Multigame Cartridge 16 in 1

   Fans of the Atari Lynx are finally in luck as there’s a flash cartridge
   available for the system. The Mateos Atari Lynx Rewritable Multigame
   Cartridge 16 in 1 can be written to with a USB linker, with space for
   up to sixteen different games. Although limited, there doesn’t seem to
   be any other Atari Lynx flash cartridge available elsewhere.

   The most quirky aspect to this device is that the games have to be
   selected through twisting a dial on flash cartridge itself. An added
   bonus of the kit too is that the same creator has made Watara /
   Quickshot Supervision and Vectrex cartridges too, meaning you only need
   the one USB linker.
     * Storage: Rewritable Flash Memory
     * Pros: Only one of its kind, cheap and shared USB linker
     * Cons: Limited storage space, unusual game selection method
