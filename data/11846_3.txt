   Entreprises pour lâ€™Environnement (EpE), created in 1992, is a
   think-tank and platform for expertise gathering around 40 French and
   international large companies from all sectors of the economy, who work
   together to better integrate environment into both their strategies and
   their day-to-day management.

   EpE provides its members with a forum for best-practice-sharing and
   debates within the business world itself, as well as with various
   stakeholders such as NGOs, policy-makers or academics.
