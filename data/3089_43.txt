Vectrex 72-in-1 Multicart

   For most of us, the Vectrex 72-in-1 cartridge will be more than enough
   to get your vector graphics fix. Coming pre-loaded with a wide
   selection of commercial games and homebrew releases, this is possibly
   the only legal multicartridge out there after the systemâ€™s library was
   put into the public domain in the mid-90s.

   While official stock of the multicartridge is running low (and only
   available as a bare bones PCB), online retailers such as Retro Towers
   also have the device in stock.
