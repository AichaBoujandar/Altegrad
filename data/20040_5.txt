   The Wilds, in Cumberland, OH, proudly welcomed a Greater One-horned
   Rhinoceros calf on August 24.

   The female calf is receiving excellent care from her mother and is the
   eighth Greater One-horned Rhino to be born at The Wilds. The birth is a
   significant achievement as the species nearly went extinct during the
   20th century.

   The calf and mom, Sanya, are doing well and have been bonding in
   pasture on The Wilds property. The Animal Management team has been
   monitoring the pair closely and has not needed to provide any immediate
   assistance, as Sanya is an experienced mother and the calf appears to
   be strong and healthy. Calves usually weigh more than 100 pounds at
   birth and gain a few pounds every day. An adult Greater One-horned
   Rhino can reach weights of approximately 4,000 to 6,000 pounds.

   Sanya, born at the Toronto Zoo in 1999, has now given birth to five
   calves since arriving at The Wilds in 2004. The calfâ€™s father, Jahi,
   was born at Zoo Tampa in 2011, moved to the Central Florida Zoo in 2013
   and then arrived at The Wilds in 2017 as per a breeding recommendation
   through the Species Survival PlanÂ® (SSP), a program coordinated by the
   Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) to maintain genetic diversity
   of threatened and endangered species in human care. This newborn is
   Jahiâ€™s first offspring.

   The Wilds, home to three Greater One-horned Rhinos, is one of only 30
   facilities in North America to care for this species. The Wilds is also
   home to 15 Southern White Rhinos. In total, more than 500 animals
   representing 28 species from around the world make up the animal
   population at the open-range, natural landscape at The Wilds.

   Once listed as an endangered species, the Greater One-horned Rhino
   (Rhinoceros unicornis) has seen a steady population increase thanks to
   strict government protection and is now listed by the International
   Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species
   as â€œVulnerableâ€. According to the World Wildlife Fund, there were only
   600 individuals surviving in their native ranges of India and Nepal by
   1975. Since then, researchers estimate the population has grown to
   exceed 3,000 Greater One-horned Rhinos living in these areas.

   â€œWe are thrilled to welcome this little rhinoceros into our Wilds
   family! Every rhinoceros is important to the survival of his or her
   species. While there has been some success in rhinoceros conservation
   recently, unfortunately, there are still threats to all rhino species.
   They are being poached for their horn, even though it is made only of
   keratinâ€” the equivalent of fingernailsâ€”and they are facing habitat
   destruction in their native ranges. We are proud to be able to
   contribute to rhino conservation by welcoming this incredible new
   arrival, as the calf represents hope for future generations of Greater
   One-horned Rhinos,â€ said Dr. Jan Ramer, vice president of The Wilds.

   The new calf may be visible to guests during either an Open-Air Safari
   or Wildside Tour. For more information about The Wilds or to book your
