What happens if you don’t put your phone on airplane mode on a flight?

It’s not that long ago that airlines stopped telling passengers to keep their
mobile phones, tablets, e-readers and other devices turned off throughout the
flight. Remember the time in 2011 when Alec Baldwin was kicked off an
American Airlines plane after becoming disruptive when a flight attendant
told him to stop playing Words with Friends? Airlines take this stuff
seriously for a reason.

Why do we have to put our phones on flight mode?

   We’re asked to turn our devices off or to flight mode because of
   electromagnetic interference from phones, tablets, e-readers,
   electronic headsets, and more. Since some planes were built before
   these became a thing, it took a while for the industry to make sure it
   was entirely safe to use them.

   These days, you’ll even see iPads and other tablets in the flight deck,
   which pilots use to store paperwork instead of lugging around big bags
   with actual paper in. You’ll see flight attendants using tablets and
   big phones too, either instead of or in addition to those reams and
   reams of dot-matrix printed paperwork. All those devices have been
   tested extensively to make sure there’s no interference.

   How to get the most out of your devices while travelling

   But that hasn’t always been the case! In fact, back in 2011, some parts
   within specific models of flight deck screen on certain Boeing 737
   aircraft proved to be susceptible to interference. How’d we find out
   that specific combination of planes and monitors — and fix it? During
   the rigorous testing process to enable airlines to offer inflight
   internet, that’s how. Part of that testing process is creating enough
   electromagnetic interference to represent an entire cabin full of
   devices of a variety of sizes, including some that are malfunctioning.
   Pretty much every airliner-equipment combo operated by a major
   international airline has now been tested.

What happens if I don't put my phone on airplane mode?

   For years, safety regulators, airlines, aircraft manufacturers and
   everyone else in the industry has known that there are dozens of
   devices left out of airplane mode on every flight. In a way, the fact
   that planes haven’t fallen out of the sky willy-nilly because someone
   left their Kindle on is the best demonstration that, for the most part,
   most devices don’t affect most planes.

   But most isn’t good enough for aviation. Some folks don’t know that
   their Kindle even has 3G, or that the Bluetooth on their
   watch/headphones/other device counts as needing to be in airplane mode.
   Some forget that they’ve packed one of those devices in the overhead
   bin. Some even blatantly ignore the rules, assuming that their vital
   email on that BlackBerry isn’t going to make their plane start to
   plummet. And it probably isn’t.

   Just how fresh is the food served in your airline meal?

   Here’s the thing: aviation doesn’t work on probablys. One of the
   reasons why aviation is safer than getting in your car, crossing the
   street, or even just staying at home (more people are casualties of
   toilet-related incidents than aviation accidents!) is that airlines and
   their regulators work with an abundance of caution.
