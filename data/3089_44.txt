Mateos Vectrex Rewritable Multigame Cartridge 16 in 1

   If the aforementioned Vectrex cartridges are not to your fancy, thereâ€™s
   one more option available. Up to sixteen different games can be written
   to the The Mateos Vectrex Rewritable Multigame Cartridge 16 in 1
   through its accompanying USB linker.

   The most quirky aspect to this device is that the games have to be
   selected through twisting a dial on flash cartridge itself. An added
   bonus of the kit too is that the same creator has made Watara /
   Quickshot Supervision and Atari Lynx cartridges too, meaning you only
   need the one USB linker.
     * Storage: Rewritable Flash Memory
     * Pros: Only one of its kind, cheap and shared USB linker
     * Cons: Limited storage space, unusual game selection method
