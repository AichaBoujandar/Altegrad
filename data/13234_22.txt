How to Start a Blog From Scratch â€“ A Comprehensive Guide

   Unless youâ€™ve been hiding under a rock for the past decade or so,
   youâ€™ve probably noticed the sudden increase in blogging websites.

   Regardless of the nature of your business, setting up a web presence is
   more important than ever before. And once youâ€™ve got your website in
   place, youâ€™ll need a blog to go with it â€“ after all, blogging is
   perhaps one of the most powerful tools you can leverage to boost sales,
   attract new customers and build brand credibility with existing
   clients.

   With all of this in mind, weâ€™ve decided to put together a comprehensive
   yet simple-to-follow step by step guide to help you create your very
   own blog from scratch. In this article, youâ€™ll find everything you need

   installing software to publishing your first blog post.

   Letâ€™s get started building your first blog!

5 Steps to Start a Blog

   Let me start off by saying that you donâ€™t need to be programming
   literate to follow this practical guide â€“ in fact, you wonâ€™t have to
   write a single line of code. To those of you who shy away from the mere
   thought of coding (donâ€™t worry; Iâ€™m no stranger in that community!) I
   say â€œFear not, for this guide is with you.â€

   Iâ€™ll walk you through five simple steps to help you launch your blog:
    1. Choose a Blogging Platform
    2. Choose Suitable Hosting
    3. Set Up Your Domain Name and Hosting
    4. Customize Your Blog
    5. Add Useful Plugins

   Now that weâ€™ve gotten all of the preliminary details out of the ways,
   letâ€™s jump right into the tutorial. Youâ€™ll have it up and running in
   the next 15 minutes â€“ I kid you not!
