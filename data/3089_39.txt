Panasonic 3DO USB Host

   Over in the depths of Russia is an incredibly talented individual that
   refuses to let the Panasonic 3DO die out. Similar to the likes of the
   Dreamcast’s GDEmu, the Panasonic 3DO now has a USB stick driven
   alternative to the on-board disc drive.

   Coming in a wide range of flavours for the different Panasonic 3DO
   systems out there, the Panasonic 3DO USB Host allows gamers to plug in
   any USB memory stick to the console to read games directly from. The
   USB Host emulates the 3DO’s disc drive perfectly, providing 100%
   perfect compatibility with every single game ever released for the
   multimedia platform.

   As great as this is, the range of devices available are very expensive
   and difficult to source. Some of them require advanced installations
   (removing chips from the console’s motherboard), while others are
   solderless plug-and-play solutions. Either way, you’ll need to do some
   research at the link below should you be interested.
     * Storage: USB Memory Sticks
     * Pros: Perfect compatibility, quick loading, menu driven interface
