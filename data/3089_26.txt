NEO Myth MD 3in1

   Similar to the other Neoflash cartridges above, their Mega Drive
   solution also relies on the same storage solution - Game Boy Advance
   flash cards. While its dated storage solution leaves a lot to be
   desired, this is the only flash cartridge on the market that comes
   equipped with a YM2413 FM chip - allowing Master System ROMs to be
   played with FM Sound.

   Unless the added music channel tempts you, avoid this outdated and
   overpriced solution.
     * Storage: Game Boy Advance Flash Cards
     * Pros: Sega Master System FM Sound Functionality, 32X Compatibility
     * Cons: Outdated, overpriced, requires other Neoflash hardware to run
