   Debi is a firecracker of a writer and it definitely comes through in
   her writing. Her lively voice, delicious recipes and gorgeous food
   images never fail to impress. She is a professional who is a joy to
   work with and always delivers content on time. I’d happily recommend
   working with her.

   Debi Traub is exactly like her food photography — fun, colorful, full
   of life, and ready to jump off the page at any given moment. As
   intricate and masterful as her food presentation appears, her recipes
   are actually simple and doable, even for someone like me who is not
   anything close to a chef. Debi also approaches everything with
   positivity and a sense of humor that makes you want to take the journey
   with her and think you can do it too
