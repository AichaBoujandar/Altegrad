Step 2

Choose Suitable Hosting

   Now that youâ€™ve made the right decision in choosing WordPress as your
   CMS, thereâ€™s just one more choice to make â€“ choosing a type of hosting
   provider.

   The decision you make at this stage will have a colossal effect on the
   outcome of your blog. You can choose to fork out a couple of dollars
   every month for self-hosting or go for a free alternative instead. And
   although the latter sounds absolutely incredible, thatâ€™s not the
   direction youâ€™ll want to head in.

Why You Should Avoid Free Blog Sites

   With free blogging platforms (non-hosted platforms) the disadvantages
   always outnumber the advantages. Always. For starters, you get a
   terrible domain name â€“ something like
   â€˜myblog.freebloggingplatform.comâ€™. Your blogâ€™s domain name has a
   significant impact on SEO and social media marketing so if you want
   your blog to really take off and be discoverable then youâ€™ll want to go
   with a self-hosting.

   A .com extension is the standard norm and nearly 75% of all websites
   have it. Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s impossible to attract millions of unique
   monthly page views with a .freebloggingplatform.com extension but how
   many successful bloggers (or any successful site for that matter) do
   you know by that domain name extension?

     â€œBrand is the sum total of how someone perceives a particular
     organization.â€

   You want a web address that rolls off the tongue easily. One that
   people will remember. One that tactfully illustrates your brand and
   communicates what your blog is all about in a concise yet relevant set
   of characters.

Disadvantages of Non-Hosted Blogging Platforms

     * URL Problem. Your blogâ€™s URL will be long, unappealing, and
       unprofessional.
     * No Real Ownership. Since youâ€™re not paying for hosting, your blog
       wonâ€™t actually be your blog â€“ itâ€™s hosted on someone elseâ€™s web
       property. This means that they can delete it whenever they want.
     * Other Restrictions. Free blogging platforms donâ€™t let you do all
       the cool stuff like monetize your blog, use themes, or install
       plugins. Worst of all, your siteâ€™s space on the server is limited
       which means you canâ€™t even upload all of the images and videos you
       were hoping would attract traffic.

   These are factors that most of us simply canâ€™t afford to compromise on.
   They are essential to the timely success of our blog and weâ€™re willing
   to spend a few bucks for it.

   Luckily enough for you, Iâ€™ve worked out the most optimal and
   cost-efficient solution after carefully analyzing the hosting industry.
   (Itâ€™s a difficult and confusing world to navigate through.) Long story
   short: Bluehost is the winner.

Why Bluehost Is Best

   Bluehost offers everything from shared hosting to optimized hosting for
   WordPress at a reasonable price. Being a first-time webmaster, itâ€™s
   best to go for shared hosting. The rest of them are advanced hosting
   services and more suitable for bigger blogs. You wonâ€™t need the kind of
   functionality they offer right away and when you feel like you do, you
   can always upgrade to another hosting plan.

   Bluehostâ€™s Shared Hosting plan is an ideal candidate for several
   reasons:
    1. WordPress users get a special discount price at $3.49/month.
    2. Youâ€™ll get a free domain name.
    3. 1-click WordPress install.
    4. 24/7 support.
    5. 30-day money back guarantee.

   It stands to reason that WordPress and Bluehost go hand in hand â€” the
   best CMS paired with an affordable and reliable hosting provider. In

   your domain name and hosting service with Bluehost.
