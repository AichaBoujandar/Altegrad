GDEmu

   As mentioned above, the GDEmu is the equivalent to the Sega Saturn’s
   Rhea - a complete replacement for the Sega Dreamcast’s disc drive which
   can boot games from SD card. By simply opening up the console,
   disconnecting the disc drive and connecting the GDEmu to the orphaned
   cable, you’ll be able to access a wealth of classics without a disc in
   sight.

   Out of the box the GDEmu’s approach to selecting which game you want to
   play is rather archaic. Games need to be placed on the SD card in
   individual folders named as numbers. By default the device will load
   the first numbered folder, and in order to move on to the next a button
   needs to be pressed on the GDEmu.

   This fiddly approach has since been addressed with some homebrew
   software known as GDmenu. By placing this package as the first game in
   folder number one, a menu driven interface will appear on screen each
   time you boot the console - allowing you to choose any game from the
   list without needing to touch the device.

   Once equipped with the correct software, there’s nothing that can rival
   the GDEmu. Having said that though, like the Rhea the creator is often
   inundated with requests for the device and more than likely sold out.
   Visit the official website often and you may be in luck.
