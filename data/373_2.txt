DIY Eyelash Nail Art

   Who needs cupids and arrows when instead, you all you need is to wiggle
   your fingertips, painted with flirtatious eyelashes, at your beloved
   Valentine?! When we spotted this adorably sassy manicure on Hannah
   Bronfman, the queen of covetable nail art, we instantly had to recreate
   it. It wasnâ€™t without some trial and error and a few strokes of the
   brush first. Practice makes perfect and weâ€™ve perfected this one for
   you. Wink, wink.

   wink2

Youâ€™ll need:

     * black nail polish
     * #0 paint brush
     * 5/8â€³ wide washi tape
     * scissors
     * nail polish remover
     * cotton pads

   winknailsupplies

   Start by cutting 1 inch strips of washi tape. Cut a flat half
   circle out of the top of each one and tape them three quarter of the
   way down your nails. You can also put the tape all the way at the top
   of the nail, which will leave just a thin line.

   eyelashnails1

   Make sure the edge of the tape is adhered to your nails. Dab large
   dollops of black polish onto a thick piece of card stock. When picking
   a polish, itâ€™s important to find a highly pigmented one â€“ one that
   would only require a single stroke to get enough color. We like this
   one.

   eyelashnails2

   Using a very fine, high quality brush makes drawing fine lines much
   easier. I like using a #0 sable brush â€“ they can be pretty expensive
   but if you clean them well, you can use them over and over again. Use
   the card stock to practice drawing lines and testing the pressure of
   your brushstrokes. Starting from left side of the nail, draw your
   curved line using the tape as a guide.

   eyelashnails3

   A tip is to put the weight of the brush against the tape side. Any
   excess of nail polish will spill over onto the tape, giving you a clean
   line on the nail.

   eyelashnails4

   Fill the brush with more polish and paint on lashes with 5 fine lines.
   Carefully peel away the tape.

   eyelashnails5

   If the brush is getting a bit clumpy or loosing its fineness, clean it
   between a cotton pad well soaked in nail polish remover. Continue the
   sane process on the rest of the nails.

   eyelashnails6

   To make an evil eye cut a piece of washi tape in the shape of a
   football, with the length matching the width of the top of your nail.
   Tape it right below your nail line. Trace the top and bottom line with
   nail polish.

   eyelashnails7

   Remove the tape and draw a circle in the middle, filling it in with
   polish. Allow one hand before starting on the next. And if youâ€™re
   very ambidextrous, you can have a friend help you with the other set of
   nails. Allow to dry completely before applying a top coat.

   eyelashnails8

   Bat those eyelashes, ladies!

   wink

       I love this! Being a visual artist and a tactile person I love the
       idea of having eyes on your fingers. There is so much of the world
       I see through my fingers. I also imagine for blind people their
       fingers (and ears) become their eyes. The eye symbolism transcends
       so many meanings for people. I recently made these hand carved cast
       rings of the all seeing eye, eye of providence, 3rd eye, whatever
       you want to call it. Itâ€™s a universal symbol and anyone can adopt
       their own meaning to it. It serves a similar representation of
       having an eye on your finger.

       "The War Powers Resolution is transparently unconstitutional"How do
       you get that? Congress, as part of their exclusive power over the
       declaration of war, simply allowed 60 days for the President to get
       their approval for committing acts of war, to allow for the fact
       that getting nearly anything through the legislative process is
       slow.The power to tell a President to stop making war is a
       necessary part of Congress's exclusive power to declare war.

       so.By taking their photos and by stating the obvious (â€œwe spotted

       seniors and makes them as dull as everyone else trudging down the
       chewing gum-caked sidewalks of New York City. Pathetic!
