Visiting the Lake District, UK

   Despite not knowing too much about the Lake District, I knew it was the
   most sensible place to stop on our way from Manchester to Edinburgh.
   After all, driving through the English countryside has been on the top
   of my bucket list for years. And finally, I got to experience it.
   Although, quite honestly, I would have appreciated at least a few more
   days to really absorb all of its beauty and history. The Lake District
   is best known for its lakes, forests and fells (mountains), and its
   associations with Beatrix Potter, John Ruskin and other English poets.
   Todd and I explored the southwest corner of the district, hitting up
   Windermere and Ullswater lakes . . .

GETTING THERE

   The Lake District is a surprising mere hour and a half drive from
   Manchester, so if you're brave enough to operate a vehicle on the other
   side of the road (thanks, Todd!), I highly recommend renting a car and
   experiencing the scenic route on your own time. However, give yourself
   plenty of time to get to your final destination (ours was Ullswater
   Lake) as you'll want to stop at all the quaint little towns along the
   way. Just northeast of Windermere Lake, the largest natural lake in the
   Lakes District and in England, you'll want to visit the tiniest village
   of Grasmere, home of the world famous Grasmere Gingerbread. Sarah
   Nelson invented Grasmere Gingerbread in 1854 in the village from where
   it gets its name and they've been continuing to make her biscuit like
   gingerbread the same way ever since. Grab some fresh gingerbread, take
   in the beautiful scenery and hit the road again!

STAY

   Set on northwest shores of Ullswater is Another Place, our final
   destination in the Lake District. The Georgian house, which was
   recently refurbished into a breathtakingly beautiful 40 room resort, is
   all about connecting guests to the surrounding elements by way of
   swimming, kayaking, paddle boarding, sailing, hiking, and cycling. I
   appreciate that the vibe here is anything but posh and exclusive,
   despite the incredibly stylish interiors and elegant ambience. Another
   Place is actually refreshingly laid back, casual and very family
   friendly, with an almost camp-like feel. I loved the different common
   areas, where guests could play board games fireside, enjoy the sunset
   over the fells with a cocktail, or just read a book poolside. I
   couldn't help but plan my next visit with my family.

EXPLORE

   There's a plethora of places to explore in the Lake District - I
   honestly believe you can spend weeks here and still not experience
   everything this region has to offer. There is one place, however, that
   must not be missed and that is the Stott Park Bobbin Mill. The 19th
   century bobbin mill, located southwest of Windermere Lake, once
   provided millions wooden bobbins to the ever growing textile, weaving
   and spinning industry in Lancashire and Yorkshire. Today, the mill is a
   working museum brought to life by tours and demonstrations run by
   English Heritage. It is, in one word, fascinating!

       AHHHH! This is so awesome! I’m hoping to go to the Lake District
       next year, but my husband wants to camp and do landscape
       photography there, rather than have a glorious tour. Haha. Maybe we
       can find a way to fit in both, but thanks for your guide, I’m
       definitely saving this for later!

     * Who says you can’t wear tie dye and hot pink in Fall?! .... I’ve
       been experimenting with ice dyeing and am absolutely obsessed.
       Thanks to @zappos’ newly launched denim shop, I recently got to
       play around with all kinds of white and light washed denim, the
       perfect medium for ice dyeing! It’s amazing what a bag of ice and a
       few ounces of dye can do . . . pure magic. ✨ I encourage you to try
       it! The tutorial is up on HWTF today. Tag your projects with
       #ZapposDenimDIY, @zappos and @honestlywtf and one of you will win a
       $500 Zappos gift card! Deadline is Oct 21st. Good luck and happy
       dyeing!! 🌈 #ad
