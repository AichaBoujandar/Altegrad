Spotted: Bandanas

   The good olâ€™ Western bandana . . . its storied past and fixture in pop
   culture makes it one inexpensive and timeless accessory. As long time
   collectors of bandanas, old and new, we love how these super chic
   ladies (and men) styled them wrapped around the neck, tied up in the
   hair or swathed around the wrist. As much as weâ€™ve devoted to the
   traditional paisley patterned squares, weâ€™ve recently been digging
   these hand printed and hand sewn versions from Japan as of late.

       I love the classic look of wrapping them in hair, but with todayâ€™s
       fashion making them more modern means any girl can wear them and
       look great. Will definitely use a few of these for inspiration this
       spring.

       I think it really does take one cool girl to pull off the bandana..
       The closest that I would ever get to wearing one is around my wrist
       or bag handle!

       I love this trend, I have yet to figure out how it works for me,
       though. I do love it in the hair. Maybe someday Iâ€™ll rock it.

     * Who says you canâ€™t wear tie dye and hot pink in Fall?! .... Iâ€™ve
       been experimenting with ice dyeing and am absolutely obsessed.
       Thanks to @zapposâ€™ newly launched denim shop, I recently got to
       play around with all kinds of white and light washed denim, the
       perfect medium for ice dyeing! Itâ€™s amazing what a bag of ice and a
       few ounces of dye can do . . . pure magic. âœ¨ I encourage you to try
       it! The tutorial is up on HWTF today. Tag your projects with
       #ZapposDenimDIY, @zappos and @honestlywtf and one of you will win a
       $500 Zappos gift card! Deadline is Oct 21st. Good luck and happy
       dyeing!! ðŸŒˆ #ad
