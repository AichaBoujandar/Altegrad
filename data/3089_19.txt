EZ-Flash IV

   Unfortunately, despite being a hugely popular handheld, the Game Boy
   Advance is yet to catch up with the rest of the gaming world when it
   comes to ‘modern’ flash cartridge solutions. The EZ-Flash IV is without
   the best cartridge on the market for the handheld, one equipped with a
   MicroSD Card slot, however, getting game ROMs to boot is a fiddly
   affair that leaves a lot to be desired.

   Instead of being able to simply drag and drop your games of choice onto
   a MicroSD Card, each and every game must be patched through EZ-Flash
   software in order to run on the device. The software in question will
   do the job just fine, however, once on the flash cartridge you’ll find
   the names of each game are taken from the ROM’s header, rather than the
   filename. This in turn means some game names are blank, some conflict
   with each other, and others can display in Japanese characters too.

   While we await a simple drag and drop solution, the EZ-Flash IV with
   its flaws is still the best Game Boy Advance flash cartridge around.
