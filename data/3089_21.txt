   Nintendo-Virtual-Boy-USB-Programable-Cartridge

FlashBoy Plus

   In 2007 the Nintendo Virtual Boy was finally given the flash card
   treatment it deserved. Richard Hutchinson released the FlashBoy
   cartridge, which was a reprogrammable Virtual Boy cartridge which
   featured enough space for a single game to be installed.

   Since then the FlashBoy has evolved into the FlashBoy Plus, a newer
   edition of the cartridge which features battery backed save
   functionality. Progress on games such as 3-D Tetris, Galactic Pinball,
   SD Gundam Dimension War, Teleroboxer, Virtual Boy Wario Land and
   Virtual Fishing could now be saved to the FlashBoy and restored on
   every use.

   Unfortunately though given that the device is being created
   sporadically by one individual, those hoping to get their hands on a
   Virtual Boy flash cartridge will need to keep a close eye on the
   FlashBoy forums. Any announcement of a new batch of FlashBoys will
   instantly be gobbled up by the ever prevalent and growing fan base for
   the Nintendo Virtual Boy. That said, they do appear on eBay from time
   to time...
