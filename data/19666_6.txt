   Scientists tweak photosynthesis and boost crop yield, proving it can be
   done

Our Vision

   RIPE is engineering plants to more efficiently turn the sunâ€™s energy
   into food to sustainably increase worldwide food productivity.

Missing link in algal photosynthesis found, offers opportunity to improve
crop yields

   Our team discovered a missing link in the photosynthetic process of
   green algae that could help boost crop productivity.

Improved model could help scientists better predict crop yield, climate
change effects

   Our team created a computer model of how microscopic leaf pores open in
   response to light to create better virtual plants.
