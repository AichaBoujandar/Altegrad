Everdrive GBA

   Given Krikzz has created a fantastic solution for the majority of
   consoles and handhelds, you’ll be surprised to know that the Game Boy
   Advance is yet to receive its very own Everdrive. That said, don’t lose
   hope - since finishing his last product Krikzz has revealed he is
   currently working on something for the Game Boy Advance.

   More on this once it arrives!
