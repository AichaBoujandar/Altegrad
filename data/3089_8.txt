NEO SNES / SFC Myth

   Neoflash are very proactive team of hardware developers that have
   brought countless solutions to ROM loading devices and import adapters
   over the years. Unfortunately though, their chance to fill a huge gap
   in the market with their NEO range of flash cartridges, was met by a
   huge mistake several years ago. Simply put, Neoflash’s intention was to
   create a family of flash cards that all relied on the same storage
   solution - their existing Game Boy Advance flash cards.

   Using clunky PC based software you’re supposed to load up your Super
   Nintendo ROMs onto the Game Boy Advance flash card, which would then
   plug into the top of the NEO SNES / SFC Myth cartridge. This also
   allowed you to use part of the cartridge for your Mega Drive ROMs (for
   use with the NEO MD Myth and NEO N64 Myth at the same time. While
   sounding great as an all-in-one solution on paper, the small capacity
   of these cartridges filled up pretty quick and you found yourself
   needing at least one card for each flash cartridge - which was
   expensive to say the least.

   Given it is the one of the most expensive Super Nintendo flash
   cartridge on offer, you’d be better investing a little more and getting
   the ultimate SD2SNES.
