Super Nintendo (SNES) Flash Cartridges

   Super-NES-Flash-Cartridges

SD2SNES

   Although it might be the most expensive flash card on the market, the
   SD2SNES is by far the most feature packed device available to date. The
   SD2SNES is the only Super Nintendo flash cartridge which has the
   ability to play all the custom chip based games released back in the
   day - and much more. While the firmware update is yet to arrive, as it
   stands this will be the only flash cartridge out there capable of
   running Super FX games like Star Fox and Stunt Race FX.

   The custom homemade MSU1 chip is also supported on the SD2SNES, which
   allows CD quality audio and full motion video playback on the Super
   Nintendo without any additional modification or hardware required. This
   introduces all new games to the Super Nintendo such as a homebrew port
   of the Laserdisc classic Road Avenger, and updates to games such as
   Zelda: A Link To The Past with orchestral soundtracks.

   If it’s a Super Nintendo flash card you’re after and price is no
   concern, then look no further than the SD2SNES.
