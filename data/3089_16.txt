USB GB Smart Card 64M

   As of today the USB GB Smart Card 64M is looking rather dated. Using
   limited on-board memory space to store game ROMs, new alternatives
   which can read from removable storage media have since arrived. As it
   stands, on average you can fit around 20 different Game Boy and Game
   Boy Color games onto the device - which can be uploaded via a USB
   cable.

   To make matters worse, the bundled software is rather flaky, and
   getting to the point where you can consider which games to write to it
   is tricky. The flash card’s drivers are incredibly fiddly to install
   and anyone running a 64-bit version of Windows is setting themselves up
   for a long and difficult journey. The other downside to the device
   though is its method of saving games. The USB GB Smart Card 64M uses
   the same battery back storage solution as seen on commercial Game Boy
   games, meaning it only has space for one save game. So if you planned
   to start out multiple Zelda adventures and Pokemon journeys on this
   single flash cartridge, you’re out of luck.
     * Storage: On-board memory (64Mbit)
     * Pros: Very cheap, USB based, menu driven
     * Cons: Awful software, driver installation is painful, only one save
       file at a time
