8. HideMyAss! (HMA)

   #1 for server network size – If HMA doesn’t have a server there, no one
   does
     * Dedicated torrenting profile: No
     * Works with: Hulu, BBC iPlayer
     * Available on: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Routers
     * Data logging: Yes (keeps connection logs for 30 days or more, but
       not bandwidth logs)

   Aside from its cheerful tone and funny theme, HideMyAss! also has a
   massive server network.

   You get high-speed servers in over 190 countries, which is pretty close
   to 100% global presence. Impressive! Don’t count on unblocking Netflix,
   though – HideMyAss! has had issues with it for a while. Hulu and BBC
   iPlayer should work fine, though.

   HideMyAss! offers strong security, with OpenVPN support and AES-256
   encryption to keep you safe. Unfortunately, it has the same problem as
   Hotspot Shield – it keeps connection logs. It also operates in the UK,
   so has to comply with some of the worst data retention laws in Europe
   and is subject to 14-Eyes jurisdiction. The result? This VPN shouldn’t
   be your first pick if you want perfect privacy.

   On the upside, HideMyAss! is easy to use with great desktop and mobile
   apps. Support isn’t ideal, though – between the limited live chat
   (workdays only) and somewhat slow response times, you may wait a while
   before getting a reply.

   Don’t Use If:
     * You need a VPN to access Netflix catalogs outside your country
       (such as Netflix US).

   The bottom line? If you need a fast VPN with a huge number of server
   locations and you don’t care about Netflix too much, consider HMA.

   You can even get a full refund within 30 days as long as it’s your
   first HideMyAss! purchase and you haven’t used more than 10 GB of
   bandwidth.
