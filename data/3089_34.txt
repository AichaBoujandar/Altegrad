   Atari-2600-SD-Card-Flash-Cartridge

Harmony

   Fans of Atari’s early gaming console will be pleased to know there’s an
   all-in-one solution at the ready. The recently revised Harmony
   cartridge is capable of playing just about every Atari 2600 game ever
   made.

   The only thing to note with the Harmony cartridge is that you’ll not
   only need to flash firmware that matches your console’s region, but
   also ensure that your game ROMs match too. This can be rather tricky
   for PAL gamers, as locating the correct ROM files can be a pain.
     * Storage: SD or MicroSD Cards
     * Pros: Fantastic compatibility
     * Cons: Set-up required depending on your console’s region
