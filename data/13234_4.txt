Step 1

Choose a Blogging Platform

   The first thing you’ll have to do is select a content management system
   (CMS) that will serve as the underlying platform for your blog. Now
   you’ve probably heard of a few of the major blogging platforms out
   there – WordPress, Blogger, Joomla, Drupal, etc.

WordPress All The Way

   I’m a huge advocate of WordPress and I wholeheartedly recommend it to
   anyone who wants to start their own blog. Here are a few simple reasons
   why:
     * It’s massive. As of the writing of this article, WordPress powers
       nearly 74.6 million websites.
     * It’s absolutely free. WordPress was essentially designed to be an
       open source project.

     * It’s secure and reliable. The dedicated team of developers behind
       WordPress, Automattic, is always updating the CMS to ensure maximum
       safety. If it’s safe enough for NASA, chances are it’s safe enough
       for you.
     * It’s scalable. Whether you want to launch a personal blog or are in
       hopes of a much bigger, CNN-sized site (yes, CNN runs on WordPress,
       too!), you can rest assured that it’ll operate without any
       glitches.

   Those of you who are launching their first blog and probably don’t have
   a ton of potential traffic lined up are far better off opting for
   WordPress. Aside from the platform-specific benefits the CMS offers,
   it’ll save you a ton of time, effort, and money.

   Hosting with WordPress is low-cost and installation takes 5 minutes.
   The best part, however, is and will always be that you don’t need to be
   exceptionally skilled in a web programming language (or even know the
   ABC’s of it) to launch and operate a successful WordPress-based blog.

   If you’re convinced that WordPress really is the best CMS out there,
   let’s move on to the next section.
