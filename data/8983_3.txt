   About Accenture

Accenture Digital

   In an era of digital disruption, we help businesses evolve from simply
   thinking digital to being digital.

Don’t follow digital trends. Start them.

   Today's disruptors are radically re-envisioning value chains and
   transforming industries. The rise of emerging technologies and customer
   demand means incremental innovation is no longer enough: Businesses
   must reinvent in order to grow and stay ahead of disruption.

   Combining the strength of three focus areas—Applied Intelligence,
   Industry X.O and Interactive—we innovate with our clients to help them
   reimagine, redesign and reinvent what they do and discover new
   possibilities for growth. Then we partner with them to scale and
   deliver breakthrough innovations, applying the New Now.
