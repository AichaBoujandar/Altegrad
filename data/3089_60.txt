   This is a great guide, thanks for taking the time to create it.

   You listed some pretty obscure ones I had no idea about even. I will
   reference this page for years to come when building up my retro system
   collection!
   You did miss one of the ODE's for the Dreamcast though, and that was
   the USB-GDrom Controller. I am sure it must have just been a mistake as
   your site has posted about them before in the past. Anyways thanks for
   the extremely detailed write up!

   Edit: Also there is a MUCH cheaper place that sells the SD adapters for
   the Dreamcast. The ones on eBay all want $30-$40 for them and charge a
   lot for shipping on top of that price.
   The one here is only $14.

   Hey there,
   you should include the DSTWO plus which features GBA, SNES, DS and even
   3DS games...
   (Link to this comment) Sato 2018-06-26 09:42
   This is still a great guide, but should probably be updated to include
   the new Ez-Flash GBA carts as well as the Everdrive GBA line.

Hardware Review: Everdrive GBA X5 (Game Boy Advance) Flash Cartridge

   20 August 2016 Cauterize Reviews - Hardware

   Everdrive-GBA-X5-Review In what could be described as the most
   anticipated arrival from Krikzz’s retro gaming headquarters, the
   Ukrainian mastermind has finally released an Everdrive flash cartridge
   for the Game Boy Advance. Simply dubbed the Everdrive GBA X5, this
   modern solution for Nintendo’s 2001 handheld enters a slightly crowded
   market with the aim of coming out on top.

   For those unfamiliar with the other options available, the Nintendo
   Game Boy Advance saw a flurry of backup devices hitting the platform
   just mere years into its release. Many of these came during the slow
   transition which home computing took towards adopting the USB standard,
   and of course the growing popularity of memory cards. This in turn saw
   several Game Boy Advance flash cartridges bundled with parallel port
   writers, whilst the newer options began to utilise writing on the fly
   via a USB cable.

   As promising as this progress was for gamers, the general experience
   was somewhat lacking when it came to playing Game Boy Advance ROMs on
   flash cartridges. If it wasn’t the unreliable parallel port
   connectivity causing issues, the proprietary software needed to either
   write ROMs or patch them to run was incredibly cumbersome. Even the
   later cards which made use of removable media also suffered from
   mandatory software causing issues, which all in all meant there wasn’t
   a simple drag-and-drop solution available.

   Despite these frustrations, these dated flash cartridges still managed
   to play the majority of hits from the Game Boy Advance’s catalogue. The
   trouble if anything arose once you decided to reshuffle your choice of
   installed ROMs - especially given storage came at a premium in the
   early 2000s.

   Fast forward to today though, MicroSD cards are now pushing 128gb in
   capacity, and you’d like to think that the days of being selective with
   which ROMs to install are over. This is where the Everdrive GBA X5
   comes in.

Introducing the Everdrive GBA X5

   Originally revealed in October 2014, Krikzz’s announcement that a Game
   Boy Advance flash cartridge was in development was met with an excited
   response worldwide. While development on the device may have been
   taking its time, the small snippets of news which arose out of Ukraine
   continued to promise just about every feature fans of the handheld
   wanted. This included support for simplistic drag-and-drop of game ROMs
   onto an MicroSD card (without the need of patching or software), a Real
   Time Clock for use in Pokemon games, near 100% compatibility with the
   Game Boy Advance library, and support for the Gamecube Game Boy Player
   too. Following the sporadic updates which trickled out, the Everdrive
   GBA X5 was finally made available to pre-order in early July 2016 with
   those lucky enough to secure one receiving their cartridge around mid
   to late August.

   Even prior to a purchase the first thing most have noticed about this
   new device is the shape of the cartridge. Instead of finding itself in
   a similar sized case to the standard Game Boy Advance cartridges, the
   Everdrive GBA X5’s form is more akin to the likes of the unique Drill
   Dozer and Yoshi's Universal Gravitation game carts. Once slotted in for
   play the cartridge’s shell sticks out of the handheld with both the
   MicroSD card slot and the on-board battery visible through the
   translucent case. While perhaps not as flush or tidy as the prior
   Everdrive GB or Everdrive GG cartridges, this small protrusion is
   purely cosmetic and doesn’t get in the way of the action.

   Everdrive-GBA-Cartridge-Size

Temporary MicroSD Card Mayhem

   With the visual side of things out of the way, we spent the next thirty
   minutes loading up a range of classics onto a 32gb MicroSD card. From
   Advance Wars to Wario Land 4, our standout choices were also coupled
   with the all important BIOS/menu files too. Unfortunately for us
   though, booting up the device for the first time presented an error
   message on screen. Reading ‘SD IO Error’ and refusing to show the game
   selection menu, we went back to the drawing board and tried formatting
   the MicroSD card and starting again. Frustratingly we were once again
   shown the error code. At this point in time we made the assumption that
   the device might not be able to handle storage as spacious as 32gb. We
   changed over to a 8gb MicroSD card and then found the exact same
   problem present once more.

   Krikzz’s products (as many in the retro gaming world will tell you) are
   second to none. The constant sight of an error message was somewhat
   unfamiliar territory, and a little worrying. As a last resort we
   switched over to a 1gb MicroSD card that’s been sat in a box of spares
   and left unused for years. Much to our surprise the Everdrive GBA X5’s
   built in menu system showcasing our selection of ROMs appeared on
   screen.

   Having finally stuck gold we decided to do some research on why the
   promise of compatibility with up to 32gb MicroSD cards wasn’t being
   held up. Looking over the discussion forums on Krikzz’s official
   website we soon found a whole host of other users suffering the same
   fate. As it stands reports suggest that the Everdrive GBA X5 struggles
   to work with MicroSD cards that exceed a Speed Class rating of 4. This
   means you’ll need to be selective in what MicroSD cards your purchase
   for use in the device at this point in time. Krikzz has since stated
   that a firmware upgrade to fix this issue will be released in the near
   future.

   The only other point worth mentioning with the MicroSD cards is that
   the Everdrive GBA X5 firmware doesn’t automatically sort ROMs
   alphabetically. As a result the game selection menu will appear
   somewhat random, when in reality it’s sorted by the order the games are
   placed onto the MicroSD card. The two ways around this are to carefully
   place ROMs on in order, or instead use software such as DriveSort to
   put them back in order once done.

Gaming on the Everdrive GBA X5

   Starting out with Advance Wars, the late 2001 war strategy game was
   chosen from the menu and running within seconds. Everything was on show
   as we remembered with the anime styled introduction playing out. As far
   as the Game Boy Advance could tell, a legitimate copy of Advance Wars
   was in the sat in cartridge slot occupied by the Everdrive GBA X5.

   Having played the first few missions of the game, we saved our progress
   and shutdown the handheld. Before moving on to another classic, we
   booted Advance Wars up again to ensure that the save functionality was
   working correctly. As you’d expect our progress was waiting to be
   resumed from where we left off. The only thing worth mentioning with
   how the Everdrive GBA X5 handles save games is the unusual way it
   stores them on the MicroSD card. Instead of using a single file format
   for saves, the Everdrive GBA X5 gives each type of save a different
   file extension. For example we have .SRM for SRAM, .EEP for EEPROM, and
   .FLA for Flash Memory. Although anything but a problem, it does mean
   that anyone wanting to copy over existing save games from emulators or
   other backups will need to not only work out what save type their game
   uses, but also rename its file extension to match up.

   On that note we decided to putting an existing save backup from Mario
   Kart Super Circuit onto the MicroSD card. By making use of the free
   software GBA Tool Advance we were able to determine that game uses
   Flash Memory for its saves, and thus we renamed our save file’s
   extension to .FLA and copied into the GBASYS/SAVE folder on the MicroSD
   card. It’s important to note here that the name of the save file must
   match that of the ROM it belongs to. Upon loading up Mario Kart Super
   Circuit the save file was instantly detected. The warm orange glow of
   the sky on the title screen of Mario Kart Super Circuit was visible - a
   sight only seen once you’ve beaten the game.

   Pressing on we tested a wide range of games including Castlevania
   Circle of the Moon, Road Trip Shifting Gears, Kururin Paradise and
   F-Zero Climax. Each and every game we selected was running like a
   dream. In an attempt to push the device further we selected the Kingdom
   Hearts Chain of Memories ROM which weighs in at a massive 256MBit.
   Needless to say Square Enix’s fantastic 2004 portable adventure was in
   action and awaiting our input.

   Elsewhere the Real Time Clock functioned exactly as expected. Within
   Pokemon Sapphire the protagonist’s bedroom clock correctly matched the
   actual time of the day, and we can only assume that the time-based
   events including evolutions would work too.

   Everdrive-X5-Menu

   Last but not least our final attempt to trip up the Everdrive GBA X5 up
   was with fan translation patches and trainers. As the Everdrive GBA X5
   is currently lacking support for Pro Action Replay or Gameshark codes,
   we opted to patch several games with (cheat) trainers that can be found
   dotted around the net. These little patches add a small screen before
   the game loads that allows you to toggle infinite lives or weapons,
   similar to the many found in cracktros in the home computing scene of
   the 1980s. Our tests soon saw F-Zero Maximum Velocity’s trainer tearing
   apart the game with instant full speed buttons and unlimited boosts on
   offer. The Everdrive GBA X5 once again showed no form of slowing down.

   On the fan translation side of things, we did hit a few hiccups but
   these aren’t faults with Krikzz’s creation. Having enjoyed what we saw
   of Kururin Paradise previously we patched the game ROM with the fan
   translation available at ROMHacking.net. Sadly this brought around a
   whole host of graphical and audio glitches, making the game unplayable.
   This is down to the method of translation/patching used here,
   presumably intended to be compatible with emulators instead of the
   actual handheld. Elsewhere the recently released Magical Vacation
   English language patch ran like a dream, with Brownie Brown’s Japanese
   exclusive adventure finally playable on the original hardware.

Conclusion

   As you may have already noticed we’ve been blown away with the
   Everdrive GBA X5. For years now the Game Boy Advance has needed a fuss
   free flash cartridge that doesn’t rely on software coded for Windows XP
   or older operating systems. While the Everdrive GBA X5’s problems with
   specific MicroSD cards may be problematic, it’s a temporary hiccup
   which will soon be resolved through a firmware update.

   Simply put, there is no other Game Boy Advance flash cartridge out
   there that’s capable of containing the entire library within -
   nevermind offering what appears to be perfect compatibility and quick
   ROM loading. Costing £94.99 from Retro Towers, it’s a worthy investment
   given just a handful of retail releases could cost you that today.

   Many thanks to Retro Towers for providing a cartridge for review.

   Hey John,
   You're in for a treat - it's a great game from what we've played so
   far. Unfortunately we can't link you directly to ROMs to download, but
   if you're wanting to play the translated version here's what you will
   need to do:
   1) Download LunarIPS for PC
   2) Download the Magical Vacation fan translation
   (http://www.romhacking.net/translations/2662/)
   3) Patch the ROM using LunarIPS
   4) Play!
   Nice and easy!
