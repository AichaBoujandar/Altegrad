   02 January 2011 Cauterize News - Site Updates
   Retro-Game-Collection-Tracking-Online To kick start the new year,
   RetroCollect has added some great new features to the rarity guide &
   release list database. As of now, you can track your retro games
   collection with us and share your lists with anyone online.

   The next time you are logged in and are browsing the RetroCollect
   rarity guide & release lists, many collection tracking icons will begin
   to appear across the database's pages. These allow you to add games to
   your collection and show the ones you have already added. There will
   also be a quick link such as this one, which will allow you to view
   your own collection list of every game you have added to your online
   collection tracker.

   It's as simple as browsing the consoles/platforms you own games for, or
   searching for specific games and clicking 'add' to place the game into
   your collection page. Should you make a mistake, you can hover over the
   'Got' icon and click the delete button on an individual game to remove
   it and continue to adjust your collection as necessary.

   Many RetroCollect users have already begun using the online retro game
   collection tracker such as GMass who is currently showing off his
   wealthy Sega Dreamcast collection or even my own list with my
   collection of Commodore Amiga and Pokemon Mini games.

   So come join the rest of the Retro Game Collectors worldwide and begin
   tracking your collection with us. It's a free service we are proud to
   be offering that will only continue to grow with time. Expect many more

   I have all my N64, Game Boy and Game Boy Color games in.
   I have 3/4 of my GBA games in.
   I am disappointed on how some of my [DEL: favorite :DEL] GameCube games
   are missing from the database. Here's what you missed: Pac-Man Fever,
   Muppets Party Cruise, Battle for Volcano Island, Meet the Robinsons,
   and the biggest surprise, Harvest Moon: Magical Melody.

Ultimate Guide To Retro Gaming Flash Cards, Cartridges & Backup Devices

   24 October 2015 Cauterize Guides - Tutorials

   Guide-To-Retro-Gaming-Flash-Cards While retro games in their physical
   form are still incredibly desirable and our first port of call for
   gaming action, flash cartridges have begun paving the way for much
   quicker and easier access to the games we love. With countless options
   on offer at varying costs, RetroCollect has compiled the ultimate and
   comprehensive guide to flash cards, cartridges and backup devices.

   If youâ€™re yet to become familiar with the term â€˜flash cartridgesâ€™ or
   even use one, then youâ€™re in for a treat. These impressive devices
   often mimic an original game cartridge (or media) in shape, however,
   their on-board software is anything but a game. The code hidden within
   one of these devices usually grants access to an on-screen menu driven
   interface to which you can access a whole library of games.

   For example, the more recent Everdrive cartridges for the Sega Mega
   Drive have a small slot on the top which allows you to insert a SD card
   filled with game ROMs. All of which can be selected and played as if
   that game was actually plugged into your console.

   There are many additional advantages to using flash cartridges and
   backup devices today. For starters, the most obscure releases from
   abroad are simply a click away and ready to be played on the original
   hardware. These feature packed devices also offer access to the
   wonderful world of homebrew and ROM hacks, games and alterations to
   existing titles which have been created by talented individuals -
   including the ability to run the equivalent to Mega CD games on an
   unmodified Super Nintendo.

   In short, flash cartridges will open up your systems to just about
   anything your retro gaming heart desires. But which consoles have such
   hardware at the ready and what might be the best choice for each
   system?

   Read on and prepare to be educated...

   Please note - this guide is intended for gamers looking to find a
   solution for enjoying homebrew software on retro gaming consoles, and a
   legal alternative for enjoying the games they already own. RetroCollect
   does not encourage piracy nor condone it in any shape or form, nor will
   it encourage downloading ROM files or the sharing of illegal software.
   While these devices can show a dark side, we write about them with the
   best intentions in mind. At the same time we hold no responsibility for
   any damage these third party devices may cause to your belongings.
