9. VyprVPN

   An impressive desktop VPN – for a price
     * Dedicated torrenting profile: No
     * Works with: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer
     * Available on: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Routers, Android TV,
       QNAP, Blackphone, Anonabox
     * Data logging: Strict no-logging policy

   VyprVPN offers customers two different versions, but if you’re a
   Windows or Mac user, you’ll want the Premium plan.

   In addition to 700+ servers and a zero-logs policy, VyprVPN Premium
   gives you the feature it’s famous for: its proprietary Chameleon
   protocol.

   An improved version of OpenVPN, Chameleon provides additional
   protection and extra muscle for bypassing geoblocks. This makes VyprVPN
   a reliable choice for accessing Netflix US and other popular streams.

   Sadly, Chameleon is currently only available on desktop apps. Still,
   VyprVPN’s base package offers outstanding privacy and performance on
   mobile. The software is leak-proof, stylish, and most importantly –
   easy to use.

   VyprVPN is by no means a budget service, but you get great discounts if
   you opt for a longer plan. VyprVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee
   so you can try the service risk-free.

   Don’t Use If:
     * You want to pay with Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies
     * You want a VPN with responsive 24/7 customer service

   VyprVPN has proven itself as a reliable provider that values user
   privacy.
