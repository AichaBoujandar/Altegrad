Wonderswan Flashmasta

   The team behind the Neo Geo Pocket Flashmasta are also working on a
   flash cartridge solution for the Bandai Wonderswan. As it stands the
   only rewritable cartridge out there to date is the elusive Wondermagic
   cartridge which saw a limited run in the Far East when the handheld was
   still being manufactured.

   The Wonderswan Flashmasta is still very much in development, but
   updates are often posted on the official website.
