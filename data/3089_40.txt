PSIO

   Believe it or not, a device is nearing release that can play Sony
   PlayStation discs from SD card. The upcoming PSIO slots into the
   parallel port of the older PlayStation models, and with a bit of
   modification to the motherboard can turn the 32-bit system into a
   powerhouse.

   As of speaking the PSIO is in a beta testing phase, however, will soon
   become available.
