The Center for Direct Scientific Communication (CCSD)

   works for the researchers’communities and their institutional
   environment (research organizations, universities). Its main mission is
   to provide tools, in the respect of open access principles, for
   archiving and the dissemination of scientific publications and data.

   The CCSD has created, develops and manages the HAL open archive, the
   conference management platform SciencesConf.org and the hosting
   platform of epi-journals Episciences.org. It is part of a network of
   national and international partners, stakeholders and operators of
   scientific and technical information.

   Created by the CNRS in 2000, the CCSD has become a service unit
   (UMS3668) joining INRIA, INRA and the University of Lyon. It is a major
   actor in the national policy of free access.
