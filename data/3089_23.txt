Master Everdrive

   Once again the Ukrainian mastermind Krikzz has provided an all-in-one
   solution to enjoying Master System ROMs on the original hardware. The
   Master Everdrive is compatible with just about every title from the
   Master System library, allowing games as big as 8MBit to be loaded into
   memory.

   Further adding to the features, the Master Everdrive can also boot up
   SG-1000 games on the Master System too, however, it is not compatible
   with SC-3000 ROMs. The only downside to the Master Everdrive is that
   some of the more obscure Korean ROMs struggle to load. Regardless, this
   is still the ultimate - and only - answer to flash cartridges on the
   Master System.
     * Storage: SD Cards
     * Pros: Compatible with nearly all games, SG-1000 functionality,
       works on Game Gear too with adapter
     * Cons: Some Korean games are incompatible
