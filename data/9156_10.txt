   This is where you get to learn how to integrate your vast knowledge of
   the supply chain and prove you’re a problem solver. In SCPro Level Two,

   effective at collaborating with others to the benefit of the entire
   supply chain. This introductory designation, which demonstrates a clear
   commitment to growing one’s supply chain expertise, is awarded for a
