Provably secure systems: foundations, design, and modularity#

   February 2011 - January 2016

   Our research project ProSecure is supported by the European Research
   Council ("Starting Grant Project"). This is a long-term project (5
   years) aiming at developping provably secure systems such as security
   protocols.

Context of the project#

   Security protocols are short distributed computer programs dedicated to
   securing communications on digital networks. They are designed to
   achieve various goals such as data privacy and data authenticity, even
   when communication channels are controlled by malicious users. Their
   increasing penetration in many important applications makes it a very
   important research challenge to design and establish security
   properties. In the last decade, formal approaches and automated
   veriÔ¨cation techniques have been successfully applied for detecting
   potential attacks. However, the security guarantees obtained so far
   usually hold in a rather abstract model, and are limited to isolated
   speciÔ¨c protocols analyzed for a few set of speciÔ¨c security
   properties. Moreover new types of protocols are still emerging in order
   to face new technological and societal challenges.

Goals of the project#

   The goal of the project is to propose foundations for a careful
   analysis and design of large classes of up-to-date protocols. We plan
   to develop general verification techniques for new classes of protocols
   that are of primary interest in nowadays life like e-voting protocols,
   routing protocols or APIs. Our techniques will first be developed in
   symbolic models where messages are represented by terms but we will
   also consider the cryptographic part of the primitives that are used in
   such protocols (encryption, signatures, ...), obtaining higher security
   guarantees. We aim at proposing modular results both for the analysis
   and design of protocols. As a particular outcome, we should
   characterize simple design principles that ease the analysis (thus the
   security) of protocols and discard families of attacks.

Research themes#

     * Security protocols: authentication and confidentiality protocols,
       e-votings, security APIs, routing protocols
     * Automatic verification: rewriting, constraint solving, automatic
       deduction
     * Provable security
