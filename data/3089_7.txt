SNES Powerpak

   Given that the SNES Powerpak from the same team that brought you the
   NES Powerpak is twice the cost of other Super Nintendo flash cards,
   you’d expect a lot for your money. Sadly though the SNES Powerpak from
   RetroZone has been outclassed as of recent, but only due to the
   device’s growing age. Technology has moved on and the SNES Powerpak has
   not.

   While the device handles Super Nintendo ROMs just as well as most SNES
   flash cards, the main drawback of the SNES Powerpak is its on-board
   menu system and software. ROMs and folders appear on-screen in the
   order you placed them onto the CompactFlash card, instead of
   alphabetically - making navigation to the game you want to play
   challenge. The device also requires empty save files to be created on
   the device beforehand for any games which may have save game
   functionality. While RetroZone do offer a downloadable empty save file
   for use, it is somewhat a daunting task having to create additional
   files for every single game you might play on a device advertised as
   being ‘drag and drop’.

   On the plus side though, the SNES Powerpak does offers DSP-1
   compatibility allowing the likes of Super Mario Kart and Pilotwings to
   run flawlessly.
     * Storage: CompactFlash cards
     * Pros: Does the job fine after initial setup, DSP-1 compatibility
     * Cons: Clunky software, lack of built-in save file creation
