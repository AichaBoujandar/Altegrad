The Podcast- Episode 3: John & Yoko's Bed-In

   45 years ago this week, John & Yoko held their Bed-In in Montreal to
   promote Peace. Knowing that they  were magnets for the press, the
   newlyweds idea was to exploit their fame for a good cause. They held
   court for a week in the Queen Elizabeth Hotel, being interviewed by
   scores of journalists for 12 hours a day, all the while laying in bed.
   Howard spoke to them twice that week on the phone from NYC.
