GB X Changer, Doctor GB and other outdated Game Boy Flash Cartridges

   Game Boy piracy was a huge problem for Nintendo back in the 90s. Not
   only was the market flooded with bootleg games, but also countless
   flash cartridges and game copiers. The majority of these today still
   offer the same functionality as those from above, however, the means of
   getting software onto these devices once again requires the long lost
   parallel port and older operating systems.

   Nevertheless theyâ€™re an interesting curio for retro game collectors.
