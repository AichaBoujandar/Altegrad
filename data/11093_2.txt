   AWStats is a free powerful and featureful tool that generates advanced
   web, streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically. This log
   analyzer works as a CGI or from command line and shows you all possible
   information your log contains, in few graphical web pages. It uses a
   partial information file to be able to process large log files, often
   and quickly. It can analyze log files from all major server tools like
   Apache log files (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format or common/CLF log
   format), WebStar, IIS (W3C log format) and a lot of other web, proxy,
   wap, streaming servers, mail servers and some ftp servers.
   Take a look at this comparison table for an idea on features and
   differences between most famous statistics tools (AWStats, Analog,
   Webalizer,...).
   AWStats is a free software distributed under the GNU General Public
   License. You can have a look at this license chart to know what you
   can/can't do.
   As AWStats works from the command line but also as a CGI, it can work
   with all web hosting providers which allow Perl, CGI and log access.
