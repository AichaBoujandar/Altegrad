   The name â€œSimply Beautiful Eatingâ€ really says it all. Debiâ€™s
   straight-forward recipes, gorgeous photos and fun glimpses into her
   kitchen will have you wishing you were in the kitchen helping out or
   your elbows on the counter eagerly waiting to lick the frosting off the
   whisk! When we work with Debi, I rest easy knowing everything will be
   delivered on time and sheâ€™ll have provided a crowd-pleasing recipe for
   our partners. And while she may be best known her baked goodies, donâ€™t
   let all those sweets fool you, her savoury stuff is fantastic too!

   When simplybeautifuleating popped up in my Instagram feed I was
   immediately taken by surprise and thought, this person is doing
   something REALLY cool and different from all the other foodie feeds I
   was following. Every week I look forward to seeing her incredibly
   gorgeous photos and reading her recipes while laughing out loud the
   entire time. No one else can make something as simple as baking muffins
   so funny and lighthearted.
