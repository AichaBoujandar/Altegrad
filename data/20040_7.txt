Paradise Park Hatches First Caribbean Flamingo

September 17, 2019

   Staff at Paradise Park are thrilled at the hatching of their first
   Caribbean Flamingo chick!

   Director Alison Hales commented, â€œWe love our flamingo group, and were
   delighted when two eggs were laid this summer. However one egg was
   infertile and then the second pair stopped incubating about a week too
   early. Keepers decided to put the egg in an incubator, not knowing if
   it would hatch, but within days the egg started chirping! The chick
   hatched successfully on 19th August â€“ itâ€™s early days but, so far, itâ€™s
   growing well on two-hourly feeds of a special â€˜fish soupâ€™ prepared by
   Keeper Becky.â€

   Keeper Becky Waite explained, â€œWe are so excited to have a Caribbean
   Flamingo chick. Our flock was very small until last summer, when five
   arrived from Slimbridge Wetland Centre. With a bigger flock size, we
   were in a stronger position to achieve breeding success. One pair did
   lay an egg earlier in the summer, which sadly was not fertile. But this
   did trigger the flock to build nests. The shallow pond area is an ideal
   location as the mud is the perfect building material.â€

   Becky continued, â€œBoth parents were hatched at Chester Zoo in July
   2002, so are 17-years-old. They came to Paradise Park in 2004. This egg
   was laid on 20th July and hatched on 19th August, so took 31 days to
   incubate. Due to the parents having stopped incubating the egg a few
   days before it was due to hatch, we stepped in and put the egg in an
   incubator. For the first few days, I am feeding the chick every two
   hours between 6am and 10pm.â€

   Flamingos form strong pair bonds, and just one egg is laid, with both
   male and female feeding the chick on a special â€˜crop milkâ€™. They are
   long-lived birds that can reach the age of 40, and are able to breed
   starting from age six.

   Paradise Park would like visitors to note that, at this time, the chick
   is not on display.
