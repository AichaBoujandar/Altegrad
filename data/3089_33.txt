C4CPC

   Although the Amstrad GX4000 is often ignored for its low sales figures,
   poor design and lacklustre library, fans have since fought back and
   made the system relevant. The newly released C4CPC flash cartridge not
   only gives retro gamers the ability to play all the GX4000 games from
   flash cartridge, but converted Amstrad CPC games too.

   While the selection of converted Amstrad CPC games is limited to what’s
   been patched by the community, new releases are arriving every day and
   making this a surefire way to enjoying the micro-computer without
   needing to unpack the keyboard-long system and accompanying monitor.

   The C4CPC can be ordered through the CPCWiki forums. It’s worth noting
   too that it is highly recommended that you invest in a new power supply
   for your system if using the C4CPC. The one supplied for the console
   does not provide enough juice to both the flash cartridge and console,
   which has supposedly damaged some systems. Full details can be found
   within the device’s CPCWiki page.
     * Storage: MicroSD Cards
     * Pros: Fantastic compatibility, can run patched Amstrad CPC games
     * Cons: Bare board cartridge due to the small size of hucards
