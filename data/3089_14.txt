Doctor V64, Doctor V64 Jr and other dated discontinued devices

   There are several other flash card alternatives for the Nintendo 64
   which still offer just as much functionality as those above. While they
   do work a treat, the likes of the Doctor V64, Doctor V64 Jr, C64 and
   Z64 are outdated due to the primitive forms of media they rely on - Zip
   disks, CDs, parallel port transfers. Some of these, however, can be
   modified to run games from hard drives and/or CompactFlash cards, but
   the hassle usually isnâ€™t worth it given the other options available
   requiring no modification whatsoever.
