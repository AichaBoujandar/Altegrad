   The Alpine Ibex enclosure at Hellabrunn Zoo gained two new
   membersâ€¦Trapattoni and Theo. Born in late May and June, the two kids
   are said to be enthusiastically exploring the rocky terrain in their
   exhibit.

   Within just one hour after birth, an Alpine Ibex kid is able to follow
   its mother on rock cliffs. As they grow, so will their horns, which
   will reach over 1 meter long by the time they become adults. Large and
   backwards-curving, male horns are used to defend their territory and
   compete for the right to breed with available females. During fight
   rituals a male will challenge his rival by rearing up on his hind legs
   and using his horns to ram his opponent with great force.

   It will still be a while before the young Ibex at Hellabrunn are ready
   to assert their authority, but visitors will be able to see them
   practicing with their horns, which at present are only a few
   centimeters long.

   "A visit to the Alpine Ibex enclosure is definitely worthwhile,â€ said
   Rasem Baban, zoological director at Hellabrunn Zoo. â€œItâ€™s always
   interesting to watch the little kids test their courage and try new
   things."

   In the mid-19th century, the Alpine Ibex (Capra ibex) was on the verge
   of extinction, primarily due to the demand for their curved horns and
   fur as coveted hunting trophies. Less than 100 individuals remained, at
   that time, and were only to be found in the Gran Paradiso National Park
   in northern Italy. The population has since recovered thanks to
   conservation efforts over the years. Today, the species is no longer
   classified as endangered.

   There are currently five populations of Alpine Ibex in Germany,
   including the regions of Bayrischzell, the AllgÃ¤u Alps, and the
   Benediktenwand.

   Hellabrunn Zoo is currently home to nine Alpine Ibex. In addition to
   the two kids and their mothers, there are four more females and one
   breeding male.

   The Alpine Ibex enclosure at the Zoo is located halfway between the
   Isar entrance and the new MÃ¼hlendorf village.
