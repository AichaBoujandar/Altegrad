   Hanif Kureishi was the latest guest writer at the Maison de la Po√©sie
   last night, as part of the Tandem Paris-London cultural collaboration.

   Sitting in the foyer before the talk I heard Kureishi say, referring to
   the person sitting next to me:

     There‚Äôs a man reading one of my books, very unusual!‚Ä

   "There‚Äôs a man reading one of my books, very unusual!" Is it? People
   talk about the death of the novel but it‚Äôs hard to estimate how much we
   are reading novels these days, unless it‚Äôs your business to know. If
   you look around on public transport 5 out of 6 people are on their
   smart devices, but given there‚Äôs now a Kindle app they could well all
   be reading his latest ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Last Word‚Ä, published last year.

   Perhaps most famous for his screenplays ‚ÄúMy beautiful Launderette‚Ä and
   ‚ÄúSammy and Rosie Get Laid‚Ä and his novels ‚ÄúThe Buddha of Suburbia‚Ä and
   "Intimacy‚Ä he is as prolific a playwright as a screenwriter and
   novelist.

   Of Pakistani and British heritage, growing up in the South London
   suburb of Bromley, it is hardly surprising that the principal themes in
   his stories are linked to immigration and mixed-race relationships.
   After being constantly asked where he was really from as a boy, he
   started questioning the meaning and thus began his interest in
   philosophy and psycho-analysis. He explored existential questions about
   belonging and the writer in him was born.

   When asked why he became a writer rather than a journalist, as others
   in his family, he said that he became fascinated by people‚Äôs obsession
   with the notion of ‚Äúthe immigrant‚Ä as though immigrants could be
   grouped altogether and not identified as specifically different
   communities. He realised he wanted to tell stories of particular
   individuals, rather than discuss immigration as a social phenomenon:
   ‚ÄúWe need better descriptions, more stories, more words. ‚Äú

   The ‚ÄúLast Word‚Ä is set in a country house, a confined space, something
   he‚Äôd always wanted to explore, ‚Äúwhere characters are locked-up and
   where you know they are going to end up killing each other‚Ä, he
   specifies with laughs from the audience.

   Kureishi reads philosophy and psychoanalysis to explore the nature of
   destruction, among other things; he wants to understand the central
   question of violence, mostly inflicted on oneself. He is also amazed at
   the thought that you can cure someone of a depression or neurosis for
   example, by having a conversation with them.

   Reading fiction gets in the way of his ‚Äúsignal‚Ä as a writer, which he
   describes as a very libidinous activity, a thought he chooses not to
   develop further.

     In the end what matters is giving the reader a good time‚Ä

   In the end what matters is giving the reader a good time and as a
   professor in the writing department at Kingston University he asks his
   students: ‚ÄúIs anyone going to pay to read this?‚Ä Engagement with an
   audience is vital he says and with this he recognises that as a writer
   he balances commerce with art.

   He recounted being a victim of fraud, having had his life savings
   stolen by a double-dealing accountant and he famously and somewhat
   controversially doesn‚Äôt shy away from using semi-biographical material
   as inspiration in his writing. In "Theft", one of a series of essays in
   ‚ÄúLove and Hate‚Ä, he describes ‚Äúa conman at the height of his psychotic
   delirium.‚Ä

   As a Londoner still, albeit West London now, he sees it as an island
   state, revealing that he‚Äôs as likely to come to Paris as he is to
   travel outside his own cosmopolitan capital.

   I asked him how he would compare the lives of young, non-privileged
   school leavers in London today with those of the characters he portrays
   in ‚ÄúMy Beautiful Launderette‚Ä, set in Thatcher‚Äôs 80s. His response
   doesn‚Äôt reflect well on the current state of things. Even those who
   have worked hard to get university degrees come out with huge debt ‚Äì
   and debt he likens to a form of control. ‚ÄúYoung Londoners can‚Äôt afford
   to rent flats let alone buy them‚Ä.

   This is true, but are they still buying novels?
