Super Everdrive

   Krikzz’s Super Nintendo offering is most definitely one you don’t want
   to dismiss too quickly. Similar to his other flash cartridges, the
   Super Everdrive makes use of SD cards to access your library of Super
   Nintendo ROMs.

   While the Super Everdrive doesn’t have the same compatibility as the
   SD2SNES with special cartridge chips - meaning the likes of the Super
   FX games (e.g. Starfox) and other special chip based games will not
   work - it does offer support for the DSP1 based games such as Super
   Mario Kart and Pilotwings.

   It’s easy to use and has out of the box drag ‘n’ drop functionality.
   Perfect for someone looking for a bare bones basic, although powerful,
   Super Nintendo flash card.
     * Storage: SD Cards
     * Pros: Best priced Super Nintendo flash card available
     * Cons: No special chip support other than DSP-1
