Story Book: The Next Chapter

   Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary has long been the home of monkeys,
   each  with their own heart-wrenching story.  It is now necessary to
   expand.  The demand continues as we learn of monkeys needing sanctuary
   - monkeys that are being kept inhumanely in roadside zoos, monkeys that
   are being bred for the exotic pet trade and, most recently, research
   monkeys. In a precedent-setting move, Story Book Farm is now home to
   the first lab monkeys to be allowed to retire after surviving their
   research obligations. We want to provide the best long-term captive
   care to monkeys who have had their wild lives stolen.

   In order to take in more monkeys - we already have a waiting list of
   two - we need to expand.  This plan to build a new sustainable
   structure and extensive outdoor areas will cost $1million.
