   Omahaâ€™s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium is proud to announce the birth of
   two Snow Leopard cubs on May 22.

   When they were one month old, the male and female cubs weighed just
   over five pounds. The cubsâ€™ parents are Rosemary and Pasha. Rosemary is
   5-years-old, weighs approximately 78 pounds, and has lived at the Zoo
   since 2015. Pasha is 10-years-old, weighs approximately 106 pounds, and
   arrived at the Zoo in 2012.

   Dad can currently be seen by guests in the Asian Highlands exhibit.
   This pair also had a cub named Victoria in 2017. Victoria recently went
   to live at the Binder Park Zoo near Battle Creek, Michigan.

   Snow Leopards are listed as â€œVulnerableâ€ by the International Union for
   Conservation of Natureâ€™s Red List. There are only an estimated 2,700 -
   3,300 Snow Leopards left in the world. The main threats facing them
   include loss of habitat, retaliatory killing from predation on
   livestock, and illegal trade in furs, bones and other body parts.

   Omahaâ€™s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium is a dedicated member of the Snow
   Leopard Species Survival Plan (SSP), a program that works to maintain a
   genetically stable assurance population of Snow Leopards in zoos.
   Research conducted by the Zooâ€™s nutrition and reproductive physiology
   departments has provided valuable information to the Snow Leopard SSP
   that is helping to improve the care and management of these amazing
   cats around the world.

   In addition to efforts taking place on Zoo grounds, Omahaâ€™s Zoo and
   Aquarium supports the Snow Leopard Trust, an organization working out
   in the field within Snow Leopard habitat. Snow Leopard Trust focuses
   primarily on community education directed toward improving the
   relationships between herders and big cats by creating incentives for
   the community to protect Snow Leopards and their ecosystem. To learn
